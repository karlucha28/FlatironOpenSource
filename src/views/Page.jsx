Additionally, each lecture page has additional information, links, and helpful resources.</p>\n<p>Workshops are part of each lecture time and are a critical component of skill-building in product design. Workshops are always focused around:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">demonstrating and practicing a design method (i.e. sketching, interviewing, user flows)</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">completing a problem-solving prompt</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">teaching design tools (Figma, Figjam, Invision, Webflow, etc)</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">critique or improving project work</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Grading</h2>\n<h3>Quizzes (15%)</h3>\nEach module concludes with a summative quiz, covering material from your readings, lectures, and labs, and reflecting learning objectives from all four lessons within the module. <br>\n<h3>Labs (15%)</h3>\n<p>Each module has labs that follow most lectures. Labs are meant to be worked on independently and should take 1 to 2 hours. Your instructor may host \"lab hours\" where you can work together on completing each lab. We encourage you to organize lab hours with cohort peers to work through labs together in the Flex program.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Do not duplicate the Figma Lab File. Instead, duplicate the \u201c\ud83d\udc49 Start Here\u201d page inside the file. Rename that page with your first name and last initial. You will be able to see your peers' work in the same file, and they can see yours. This is intentional and encourages everyone to work in the open and learn together.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">To receive credit for completing the lab, you must submit a link as outlined in the short video below. Labs are complete/incomplete, and each lab is worth 1 point.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/600675686?h=aeca4fa848\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/600675686\">DLab Student Overview</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Module Assessments (70%)</h3>\n<p>There are three assessments in each Phase.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Unlike labs, for each assessment, you will <strong>duplicate the Figma file.</strong></li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Read each step carefully.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">The rubrics used for grading the final designs are at the bottom of each assessment.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Your professionalism in the course is considered paramount. Meeting deadlines, showing up for scheduled 1 on 1's, and providing peer feedback are all ways to get top marks for professionalism.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>");
