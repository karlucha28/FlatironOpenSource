Your final project for this course. This is the capstone project\nthat you'll be showing off to demonstrate all the things that you've learned so\nfar. This is awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we dive into what your project is going to be about, we need to establish\nsome ground rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFinal Project\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the time to dive into React libraries you've gotten interested in, or\nplay with APIs that would have taken too long to figure out during a shorter\nproject week. This is the time to make the app that you've always wanted but\nnever had, write up a bunch of custom CSS, and really put your skills on\ndisplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause we're asking you to show off a specific set of skills, we have some\nrequirements. It should be obvious that one of the requirements is that you need\nto use the things that you learned during this course. This isn't the time to\nbuild a game with Unity or explore the MEAN stack or try and whip up a React\nNative app. You've done a ton of learning already — it's time to apply all of\nthat knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProject Requirements\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe listed requirements below are guidelines that should help you to determine\nwhat the complexity of your project should be.

We\nrecommend Trello or a Github Project Board. Use this to track what you're doing\nand what you need to work on.

We're not yet worried about what your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is or\nwhether your idea is practical — just come up with ideas. Think of this as your\nresearch and development phase. Take some time to research and learn some\nadditional concepts that could be helpful in your project plan such as Auth,\nRedux, and complex APIs and libraries. Your instructor will give you an idea of\nwhat is and isn't practical, and provide some guidance on the technologies\nyou're investigating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eProject proposals must be submitted, presented, and approved in advance of\nbuilding your capstone.
