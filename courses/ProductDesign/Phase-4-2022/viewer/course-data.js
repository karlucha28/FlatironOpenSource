The waterfall method also sometimes leaves teams sitting idle, waiting for the previous deliverable to receive sign-off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2001, a group of developers released the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, calling for developers to move away from working towards a single massive product launch in favor of short sprints with modest short-term goals.

The Lean UX design approach created by Gothelf combines principles of user experience design with Agile development methods and Lean Startup techniques. When I say Lean Startup, I'm referring to an influential 2011 business textbook by Eric Ries called The Lean Startup that emphasizes reducing waste by increasing the frequency of contact with real customers using rapid prototyping methods.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLean UX prizes cross-functional teams, meaning teams don't work in isolation, but instead learn from each other. Visual design, software engineering, product management, interaction design, content strategy, marketing, and quality assurance teams share information and see problems from different points of view.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLean UX teams have permission to fail, meaning it's not necessary to thoroughly complete research projects before creating designs. Instead, teams make assumptions based on what they currently know about their audience. Using that assumption, teams form a hypothesis about how a particular solution might impact user and business outcomes\u0026nbsp;and create a testable design iteration. That testable design iteration is known as a minimum viable product or MVP. We'll take a closer look at MVPs before long.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLean UX methods encourage continuous discovery. Every time a testable iteration or MVP gets created, design teams put it in front of target users and discover how they respond. Get out of the building means that Lean UX prizes contextual inquiry. Observe users in their natural environment as much as possible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLean UX removes much of the waste created by the waterfall method. By testing your work frequently, you can identify usability problems, discard invalidated hypotheses, and stop working on features users don't need.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"lean-ux-|-introducing-lean-ux"},{"id":501722,"title":"üé¨ Lean UX | Minimum Viable Product (MVP)","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"LEAN UX Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765807797?h=24be6c532d\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let's take a look at minimum viable products. Minimum viable products are central to the Lean UX cycle, which consists of Think, Make, Check. In the Think stage, design teams think of a new hypothesis based on assumptions made about the needs and behaviors of the target audience. In the Make stage, design teams create an MVP to place in front of target users during the Check stage. Designers then take what they've learned and repeat the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou shouldn't be spending any more time making things than thinking or checking. Building an MVP means doing just enough work to test your hypothesis with users. In his book The Lean Startup, author Eric Ries defines MVP as that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. Note the emphasis on \"least effort.\" Doing as little work as possible isn't lazy. It's lean. The faster you find out whether your hypothesis is worth pursuing, the less you invest in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes changing directions much easier, which increases the agility of your team. MVPs can vary in fidelity depending on the stage of your project and what exactly you're hoping to learn about your users. If color, typeface choice, iconography, and imagery are central to the question you're asking, a high fidelity MVP may be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, work with the lowest fidelity MVP possible. Remember, the sooner you can place your MVP in front of target users, the sooner you'll know whether your idea is something you should continue working on. Low fidelity methods like paper prototypes are the most efficient way to explore concepts quickly and discard unusable ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital wireframes take longer to create than paper prototypes, but they require less imagination from users when it comes to their functionality. Wireframe prototypes are also generally easier to test remotely than paper prototypes. A landing page is a single webpage that appears in response to clicking a marketing promotion, a marketing email, or an online advertisement. Landing pages present information relevant to the viewer and a clear call to action. Landing pages can make effective MVPs because you don't have to create the rest of the website to gauge interest in your idea. Creating a simple landing page for a non-existent product can generate feedback and measure user enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat kind of conversation should determine what an MVP looks like?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWho should be present at that conversation?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eCan you think of any situations where an MVP might take another form other than the methods discussed in this lecture?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"lean-ux-|-minimum-viable-product-mvp"},{"id":501724,"title":"üé¨ Lean UX | User Stories","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"LEAN UX Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765807774?h=ede1743306\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, let's examine the role User Stories play in the Lean UX methodology.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUser Stories are not project requirements or lists of features. They're end goals expressed from a user's perspective. What value does your current solution offer the user?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUser Stories keep teams focused on solving real problems faced by users and keep the whole team moving towards a common goal. Working with User Stories rather than project requirements encourages teams to test out creative solutions. And breaking a project into short sprints with modest goals provides many small victories and drives momentum.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking about how to format User Stories, start with a persona. In other words, you should have a solid idea of who you're building this product for. The task or action describes what the user is trying to achieve. The description should avoid mentioning the user interface or any specific features someone might use when performing the action.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe objective or purpose explains the larger problem that needs solving. What is the overall benefit of completing this task or action?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's an example of a User Story. Notice that it lists who the user is, what they want, and why they want it, without specifying how a user interface helps the user solve their problem. Keeping User Stories simple and concrete helps keep a project user- centered and goal- focused and helps limit the scope of an MVP to a particular task.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"lean-ux-|-user-stories"},{"id":447849,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 10.1 Lean UX","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":"must_submit","completed":true,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lab-graphik.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-heading=\"Overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo complete this assignment, follow the instructions for üî¨ \u003cstrong\u003eLab: 10.1 Lean UX\u003c/strong\u003e in Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e","exportId":"g517e0713c013df23ce70fbee8b03a784"},{"id":447852,"title":"üìö Resources: Lean UX","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003ch3\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/leadership-insights/designers-guide-lean-agile-ux/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Designer‚Äôs Guide to Lean and Agile UX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Simple Introduction to Lean UX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://adamfard.com/blog/lean-ux-design\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Ultimate Guide to Lean UX Design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/lean-ux/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA beginner‚Äôs guide to Lean UX (+5 lessons from Jeff Gothelf)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.userzoom.com/blog/what-are-user-stories-and-how-do-they-help-make-better-products/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat are user stories and how do they help make better products?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"resources-lean-ux"}]},{"id":47634,"name":"Phase 4 Project Brief","status":"completed","unlockDate":null,"prereqs":[],"requirement":null,"sequential":false,"exportId":"g84b2bd4f55563325902f68c82c2e25b3","items":[{"id":466261,"title":"Project Brief: Better School Choice","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Phase 4, you‚Äôll work on one continuous project throughout the phase.

My name is Anwar \u0026nbsp;and I'm part of the Product Design curriculum team here at \u0026nbsp;Flatiron School. In this series of lectures, we'll be discussing the Jobs To Be Done framework. Let's start with a discussion question. What would motivate you to buy a drill?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe some of you would buy one just to have one, just in case, or to have your tool set feel more complete. But most people buy drills when they're looking to build something. In the words of Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt, people don't want to buy a quarter inch drill. They want a quarter inch hole.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, sometimes it's helpful to look beyond the immediate step facing users and see it as part of a larger process for achieving a more meaningful goal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, \u0026nbsp;Ikea bought TaskRabbit, \u0026nbsp;one of the best known startups in the gig economy that connects freelance labor with local demand, allowing consumers to find help with everyday tasks. Why did Ikea start offering furniture assembly by TaskRabbit ? Because they recognized that Ikea customers aren't motivated by assembling furniture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey want to be organized, express their individuality, and feel comfortable in their home.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Jobs To Be Done framework, we analyze why people hire products, services, software, and ideas, and then discover innovative opportunities to grow.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jobs To Be Done framework helps us identify the outcomes users ultimately hope to accomplish when hiring a product or service. Understanding customer needs from their point of view helps us pinpoint new opportunities. Clayton Christensen, author of the Jobs To Be Done framework, illustrates this with a story he calls \"hiring a milkshake\".\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy observing customers who bought milkshakes from fast food restaurants, Christiansen discovered many customers wanted a treat they could enjoy one-handed during a long and dull drive to work. Once we recognize what jobs customers ultimately want the milkshakes to fulfill, we can make thicker milkshakes that lasts for a longer portion of the commute.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how does one use the Jobs To Be Done framework? The first step is to identify the jobs customers are actually hoping to accomplish. If a customer wants to purchase running shoes, what is the main job to be done?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you said to go running regularly, that's not bad, but we might categorize that as a related job to our customer's main job: to get more exercise and get healthy. Knowing that helps us realize that our competition extends beyond direct competitors, like other running shoe brands. Customers could also get more exercise with a bike, or a jump rope, or a set of weights.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we've defined our competition, we can determine our criteria for success. How will we measure how satisfied customers are with our proposed solution? Finally, we'll create desired outcome statements, which provide insight about the things customers value most. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"jobs-to-be-done-|-introduction"},{"id":501742,"title":"üé¨ Jobs to Be Done | Identify Job Types","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Jobs to Be Done | Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765841518?h=a5077e1afe\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen using the Jobs To Be Done framework, what process do we use to identify our user's main job? And what other types of supplementary jobs are there? Let's take a look. A job is not what you design. A job is what the job performer wants to get done. So returning to our example of a company selling running shoes, buying shoes isn't our customer's main job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's getting more exercise. The customer might have related objectives, such as running a certain distance each week. An emotional job might be to feel pride in meeting those running goals, or to avoid a family history of heart disease. And many jobs have a social component such as bragging about your improved physique on social media. Understanding the main, related, emotional, and social jobs customers want to get done is achieved through qualitative research methods, such as interviews and contextual observation. With the Jobs To Be Done framework, we can start looking for ways to systematically create value. The provided questions can help guide our search and keep us from missing opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great way to start is to think about the biggest problems with the current solutions. Can the job be executed in a more efficient or effective way? Do some customers struggle more with executing the job than others? In what contexts do customers most struggle with executing the job? To make our analysis work better, we want a team of experts from different fields like marketing, design, engineering, and even target customers to join this discussion.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"jobs-to-be-done-|-identify-job-types"},{"id":501745,"title":"üé¨ Jobs to Be Done | Job Maps","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.2 JOBS TO BE DONE Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765841510?h=f0b2d23635\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's take a look at the role Job Maps play within the Jobs To Be Done framework. A Job Map is a visual depiction of the customer's main job that explains step by step exactly what they are trying to get done. Mapping out the job enables teams to not only think of what can be done to support the customer's journey, but also identify places where customer needs are overlooked and customers face an unsatisfying experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of creating a Job Map is not to find out how the customer actually executes a job, as that only generates maps of existing activities and solutions. Instead, the aim is to discover what the customer is trying to get done at different points in executing a job and what must happen at each step in order for the job to be carried out successfully. The first four steps here‚Äì\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edefine the objective, locate and prepare tools for completing the task, and confirm readiness‚Äìare preparatory steps a customer takes in order to execute a job. After execution, the customer will monitor the results, make modifications as needed, and conclude the task. A Job Map is not a customer journey, service blueprint, or workflow diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt does not reflect what a person does to discover, learn about, select, buy, and use a product or service. It instead focuses on customer needs and describes what they are trying to get done independent of any specific solution. When companies focus on jobs customers need to get done, they can use Job Maps to break jobs into steps and find innovation opportunities that are the key to growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these innovation opportunities can be found by asking meaningful questions while examining each individual step within a Job Map. Do some customers struggle more than others with this step? Is this step more difficult to execute successfully in some contexts than others? What are the biggest drawbacks of current solutions used to execute this step?\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"jobs-to-be-done-|-job-maps"},{"id":501747,"title":"üé¨ Jobs to Be Done | Criteria For Success","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.2 JOBS TO BE DONE Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765841492?h=0560681a60\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo use the Jobs To Be Done framework effectively, it's critical you establish clear criteria for measuring success. What do customers need when performing a job, and how will you gauge how successful they are at having those needs met? You can measure needs and success rates by using Desired Outcome Statements, which consists of four parts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe direction of change starts with a verb showing what the customer hopes to change. The unit of measure, specifies what the customer wants to increase or decrease. The object of the need is the thing being measured or controlled, while the clarifier provides contextual clues to clarify circumstances.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose your customer wants to attend a conference related to their industry. They're hoping to learn valuable information, share some of that information with coworkers, and network with conference attendees. How can we use Desired Outcome Statements to create measurable success criteria related to their trip to the conference?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we see four examples. Our first Desired Outcome Statement, \"increase the likelihood of getting permission from a boss to attend\", can be divided into four parts. Increase is a measurable direction of change. If a customer was previously only 50% successful, we can try to improve that number. The likelihood is a measurable rate of success.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer's need is represented by the third part of the outcome statement. They need to get permission. Our outcome statement ends with a clarification. When does the customer need permission? When asking a boss to attend the conference.

Goal- directed design places heavy emphasis on the end goals users hope to achieve. Activities and tasks are intermediate steps that help someone reach a goal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActivity- centered design is a design model that looks how activities in a system lead to results. The focus is not just on the user, but on the whole system.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a customer journey map, a hierarchical task analysis diagram starts with a goal and a scenario and then shows the most critical tasks needed to reach the goal. In user experience, these tasks are called operations. Designers can consider the overall number of tasks, the frequency of a task occurring,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe cognitive complexity and physical requirements involved in completing a task, and the time each task takes to complete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's look at a real- life Jobs To Be Done case study. In 2015, the year Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey reassumed \u0026nbsp;the position of CEO, the company posted a loss of over $500 million. Under Dorsey's leadership, twitter identified that the company had become overly reactive to innovations by tech industry peers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey used the Jobs To Be Done framework to focus on just three core customer jobs: keeping up to date on the news, holding conversations, and getting paid. By prioritizing these three tasks users hire Twitter to do and defining measurable outcomes related to those tasks, Twitter's revenue increased to above $4 billion in 2021.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen implementing the Jobs To Be Done framework, it's worth considering whether the customer's ultimate goal is to complete a straightforward task, or whether the goal is longer- term behavioral change. If the job is to complete a task, we can measure success by the completion of each activity. However, if the goal is long-term behavior change, we measure success in terms of progress towards that goal. If the customer's goal in preparing dinner is motivated by being thoughtful, we can call this a \"be\" goal, with a customer focus on behavioral change while working towards an ideal self. We interpret this differently than a \"do\" goal such as preparing dinner to satisfy immediate hunger.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we examine \"be\" goals, note that success isn't dependent on completion of an activity. Even if the dinner you made for a loved one is cooked badly, you might still feel more thoughtful afterwards. You might also switch activities next time by writing a poem or buying flowers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do\" goals and \"be\" goals are both useful in the design process. Make sure you know which one you are designing for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat is the first thing you do as you begin performing a job? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","exportId":"jobs-to-be-done-|-deeper-dive"},{"id":447866,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 10.2 Jobs to Be Done","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lab-graphik.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-heading=\"Overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTo complete this assignment, follow the instructions for üî¨\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLab: 10.2 Jobs to be Done \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003ein Figma.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e","exportId":"g0175514304b9c0b330c928fb7f1640c0"},{"id":447868,"title":"üìö Resources: Jobs to Be Done","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-jobs-be-done/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePersonas vs. Jobs-to-Be-Done\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/personas-vs-jtbd/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePersonas vs. Jobs-To-Be-Done: What‚Äôs The Difference And When To Use Them\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/jobs-to-be-done-framework\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInnovate with Purpose: An Overview of the Jobs to Be Done Framework\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://pony.studio/design-for-growth/jobs-to-be-done-how-to-start-examples\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJobs to be Done: The First 3 Steps + Practical Examples to Help You Get Started\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/defined/jobs-to-be-done\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJobs to be done | InVision Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eüé¨ Videos\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQFUHapOJsQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"resources-jobs-to-be-done"}]},{"id":46297,"name":"10.3 Balancing User and Business Goals, Feature Prioritization","status":"completed","unlockDate":null,"prereqs":[46294],"requirement":"all","sequential":false,"exportId":"g43cf338c2e8476edfc1ffde7ac0be0f6","items":[{"id":447833,"title":"Business Goals vs. User Goals","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFinding the right balance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core values for UX-driven product design include empathy, ethics, and usability, with the overall goal to enhance user satisfaction.

In this series of lectures, we'll be discussing two topics: balancing user and business goals and feature prioritization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe content we'll be covering includes why designers need to speak the language of business, how to earn the trust of your stakeholders, and different methods for prioritizing product features. Let's begin with learning to speak business. The first term to discuss is tradeoffs. Designers need to be aware not only of business goals, but also of limitations such as time, budget, and technical capabilities. Tradeoffs happen when striking a balance between factoring in business goals and limitations and creating an optimal user experience. When deciding on tradeoffs, it often helps to create a two dimensional graph with increasing user value on the Y axis and decreasing effort by organization on the X axis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a proposed improvement or solution offers high user value and requires low effort to implement, teams should prioritize it. Keep in mind that while a product designer is a built-in advocate for the user, the user doesn't hire the product designer. The business does. You have an equal responsibility to address business objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny proposed improvement or solution should not only benefit the user, but also meet business goals. The term Product Sweet Spot can be used to describe situations where designers have considered three factors. The first is user needs. What makes the user's ability to complete tasks easier? What makes users feel confident, competent, and in control when using your product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is business needs. How will the business make or save money? How will the business gain new customers or keep existing ones? The third is technical constraints. Do we have sufficient time and budget to implement this feature? Do we have access to the right technology? A product designer who considers all three factors gains respect and earns their seat at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's consider a scenario that misses the Product Sweet Spot. Have you ever had trouble canceling a subscription? What was the product? Why was cancellation so difficult? Making it impossible to cancel a subscription is a dark pattern. It benefits the business financially in the short term, and it's probably not hard for developers to build. But doing so is damaging to the brand's image and shatters user trust. Now let's flip the scenario. What if you designed an interface where the cancel button was bold and the first thing users saw on their account page?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClicking it would cancel user subscriptions without any warning or any chance for the users to change their mind. While this would create a seamless experience for users, and would be easy for developers to implement, the business would likely suffer. Products sometimes need to keep users for a length of time to convince them of the value they provide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis scenario isn't thinking about the business or the cost of the design decision. Chances are, with metrics showing an uptick in cancellations and revenue going down, this designer would not be hired again. Your job is to create solutions that meet both user and business needs. Is the solution always black and white?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably not. You have a responsibility to advocate for the user that isn't in the room, but also for the business that hired you to make a better product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eApart from the cancellation flows we've already discussed, can you think of any features and products you've used that only solve business needs, but don't consider user needs?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat about the reverse? Can you think of product features that benefit users, but increase business costs to maintain?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","exportId":"balancing-user-needs-and-business-goals-|-speak-business"},{"id":501775,"title":" üé¨ Balancing User Needs and Business Goals | Earning Stakeholder Trust","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.3 BALANCING USER + BUSINESS GOALS Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765851893?h=151dd3cf11\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, let's talk about earning stakeholder trust. We'll start by defining a variety of stakeholder specializations. A Product Owner is an individual responsible for advocating for stakeholder needs and making sure decisions are made with an eye on maximizing business value. A Project Manager applies project management methodologies and tools to ensure projects deliver the expected results within scope, time, and budget. A Functional or Technical Lead provides input on behalf of the engineering team and assesses the technological feasibility of proposed ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Subject Matter Experts or SMEs are staff members who exhibit a high level of expertise in a specialized job, task, or skill. Before we go any farther, here's a scenario to imagine. You're in a room full of stakeholders, presenting data in an attempt to convince the team to make a drastic change to the product site map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the chances everyone is following along, understanding your motivations, and agreeing with you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is no matter how convincing your data, facts alone aren't persuasive. The relationships you build with people in that room will make them trust you and thus your facts. Work on the same team and bring everyone along on the journey. When investing in relationships with stakeholders, here are a few things to keep in mind. Lead with positivity. No one wants to just hear a long list of negatives about their product. Practice empathy. Understand stakeholder perspective, goals, and Key Performance Indicators. Understand where stakeholders are coming from before trying to convince them to change directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe honest and open about progress and leverage stakeholder help to remove blockers. Be proactive. A great product designer looks for opportunities and proposes improvements rather than just following orders. At the same time, here are a few things to avoid. Don't rely on facts alone. Don't be a know-it-all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvoid relying on complex terminology and techniques that make you sound impressive and intimidate your audience. Invite stakeholders into the conversation and ask questions to show you're interested in what they have to say. What's on your mind? How did you decide to take that approach? Why is this important to you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions like these are a great way to extend empathy and build trust. Now, here's a workshop scenario for you to practice. Your stakeholders have declared a business goal of limiting customer service requests by requiring users to filter through FAQs before viewing a customer service phone number or submitting a ticket. On the other hand, your users have a goal of contacting support as quickly as possible so they can get their problems solved. What can we design as a possible solution that meets both of these objectives? Pause the video and take 10 to 15 minutes to sketch out a few possible solutions on paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. How did you do? Let's discuss a sample solution. Pointing users to the right answer in a well-organized FAQ section solves both problems. Users get help faster and the business cuts down on support tickets. To do this, you might implement a system that quickly suggests a few common support answers based on category using either dropdowns or a suggestive search.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"balancing-user-needs-and-business-goals-|-earning-stakeholder-trust"},{"id":501778,"title":"üé¨ Balancing User Needs and Business Goals | Feature Prioritization","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.3 BALANCING USER + BUSINESS GOALS Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765851874?h=e54c296f63\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes design team meetings and meetings with stakeholders can grow argumentative if everyone present has a different idea of what features to prioritize. In the words of UX consultant Paul Boag, it is absolutely crucial to identify what core activities you want to support so that you have a clear picture of what lies outside of that core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, having a clear set of user and business goals identified will help you identify which features are most critical to achieving those goals. So what should we not be using to drive our feature prioritization decisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shouldn't trust gut reactions. Sometimes people push an agenda because of a recent personal experience or a bit of negative feedback from an investor. While these arguments have a certain emotional appeal, feature prioritization should be backed up by data and user research. As for sales and support requests,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethese are the people on the front lines of your company. If they're hearing complaints, they'll tell you. However, don't forget there is a difference between what users say they want and what research demonstrates they actually need. How about the ROI or return on investment from a single feature? While a particular feature may promise more business revenue, more income doesn't always equal a better experience for your users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat characteristics are common to a positive feature prioritization experience? Transparency means everybody present should be able to see and understand how priorities are set. Consistency means sticking to a feature prioritization method quarter after quarter and not making arbitrary changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about fairness? Stakeholders might feel disappointed when their favorite feature isn't prioritized, but the disappointment is lessened when they perceive that the decision-making process is a fair one. Outcome orientation means we don't just prioritize features individually. Instead we view them holistically, searching for bundles of features that provide measurable value to the user and business. As for speed, it's always important to not only estimate how long a particular feature will take to implement and how much effort it requires from designers and developers, but also to communicate this clearly to stakeholders. Finally, keep all participants engaged by providing them a chance to offer feedback and stay involved and informed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's take a look at a few common feature prioritization methods used in the industry, including the Kano model, the Effort versus Impact matrix, the Eisenhower matrix, the MoSCoW method, and the WSJF method. The Kano model prioritizes features according to two competing criteria: their potential to satisfy customers and the investment needed to implement them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the strength of the Kano model is that it approaches feature prioritization from the user's perspective, it can be a bit complex to implement and for team members to understand. The Effort versus Impact Matrix can be a great way to think about the problems users face within your product. The x-axis on this two dimensional matrix is labeled Impact and refers to the value of solving a specific problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the problem isn't a major blocker for users or the solution doesn't offer much value, the impact will be minimal. The y-axis is labeled Effort and represents the amount of labor the solution will take and the feasibility of solving the problem. Former president Dwight Eisenhower is credited with creating a distinction between Important tasks that contribute to long term goals versus Urgent tasks that require immediate action and offer only short term benefits. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, if a task is both important and urgent, you should do it right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a task is important, but not urgent, you should schedule a time to handle it relatively soon. If a task is urgent, but not important, you should delegate it to someone else whenever possible. And if a task is neither urgent nor important, you should delete it from your list of todos. The letters M, S, C, and W in the name of the MoSCoW method\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estand for Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have. Features in the Must have quadrant of a Moscow matrix are non-negotiable product needs that are mandatory for the team to deliver. Features in the Should have quadrant can add significant value to the product, but are not vital to add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeatures in the Could have quadrant have less impact and are only nice to have. And features in the Won't have quadrant offer little value and could be postponed or eliminated from consideration. The WSJF method uses a math formula to determine an urgency score for each task. To calculate the urgency score, we add up the cost of delay and divide by the size of the job. The cost of delay is found by adding the user business value, the time criticality, and the risk reduction or opportunity enablement score. The user business value looks at how the feature impacts user and business goals. To determine the time criticality, ask yourself, is there a fixed deadline? Might we lose customers if this is not completed in a certain time? As for risk reduction or opportunity enablement, what is the risk if you delay implementing this feature? Will hurrying allow us to seize an opportunity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you've added these three scores and divided by the difficulty of delivering the feature, you have a WSJF priority score. The higher the score, the more important the task is to complete.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"balancing-user-needs-and-business-goals-|-feature-prioritization"},{"id":447841,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 10.3 Balancing User \u0026 Business Goals","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":"must_submit","completed":true,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lab-graphik.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-heading=\"Overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTo complete this assignment, follow the instructions for üî¨\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLab: 10.3 Balancing User \u0026amp; Business Goals \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003ein Figma.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e","exportId":"g8b6d96fe827bc978b61ecf0d8bb7e01a"},{"id":447844,"title":"üìö Resources: Balancing User and Business Goals, Feature Prioritization","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003ch3\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/the-product-strategy-stack\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Product Strategy Stack\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://miro.com/blog/four-methods-to-align-your-ux-strategy-with-your-business-goals/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFour methods to align UX strategy with your business goals\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.userzoom.com/ux-library/13-expert-opinions-on-how-to-balance-business-and-user/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e13 expert opinions on balancing business and user objectives\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prioritization-methods/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e5 Prioritization Methods in UX Roadmapping\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://adamfard.com/blog/feature-prioritization\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFeature Prioritization Frameworks: Build Only What Matters\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eüé¨ Videos\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFpKtu3OgOA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"resources-balancing-user-and-business-goals-feature-prioritization"}]},{"id":46306,"name":"10.4 Behavioral Design","status":"completed","unlockDate":null,"prereqs":[46294],"requirement":null,"sequential":false,"exportId":"g3b3bdb106b4444bbb8ec40c497dc4dd4","items":[{"id":447875,"title":"Mental and Conceptual Models","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eFinding a match\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIn user experience design, the goal is to find a match between the users‚Äô mental models and the product‚Äôs conceptual model to bring about positive and valuable experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e\n\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eMental models\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eMental models are representations of a person‚Äôs intuitive understanding of how something functions based on past encounters, exposure to information, and sound judgment or intuitive perceptions (Source\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/05/mental-models-and-user-experience.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUX Matters\u003c/a\u003e).

In the words of journalists and content strategist Jory MacKay, behavioral design focuses on change, not coercion. It emphasizes helping users achieve their own goals while using your product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe've discussed previously that using techniques like Nir Eyal's Hook Model and addictive patterns such as infinite scroll to create unwanted habits in users is ethically problematic. But what if users want to change their behavior?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a prompt for discussion. What apps have you used to try to break an old habit or build a new one? What was the experience like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's look at some examples of behavioral design. One common category of behavioral design products is language acquisition apps. Duolingo encourages users to build daily language learning habits through a combination of positive encouragement and celebrating streaks of daily engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsers might also use an application to help them form money saving habits and meet financial goals. Mint allows users to create a custom budgeting goal, then offers guidance on how to distribute paychecks, budget, and reduce spending to achieve that goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany behavioral design products focus on improving user health and wellbeing. Fitbit supports a user's health journey using a system of notifications aimed at increasing physical activity, improving daily nutrition intake, and building better sleep habits. \u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"behavioral-design-|-what-is-behavioral-design"},{"id":510752,"title":"üé¨ Behavioral Design | Understanding Decision Making","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.4 BEHAVIORAL DESIGN Part 02.mp4\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/774009159?h=67fbaeb6f1\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do people think about when making a decision?

These are tasks we pay no conscious attention to. Think about chatting with a coworker and unthinkingly following them onto an elevator. Sometimes external cues trigger our decision-making process. A sign indicating one of the building's two elevators is out of service might make us wonder whether waiting for the other elevator is worth it. Internal cues happen within the user's mind. Perhaps we remembered reading an article the other day indicating that taking the stairs, boosts our heart health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur brains are built to do most problem solving using System One thinking, which is fast and automatic. If we're used to taking the elevator every day, we might board the elevator as an unconscious reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we haven't boarded the elevator unconsciously, our brains can use System Two thinking to evaluate the costs and benefits of using the stairs. System Two thinking is slower and involves conscious effort. When evaluating our decision, we might focus on highlighting the benefits of the stairs, as the activity provides exercise. Or we might minimize the costs, reminding ourselves that taking the stairs is only a few minutes slower than the elevator. We might also downplay the alternatives. If the elevator is crowded and slow at lunchtime, this can make the stairs seem more appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth step in the CREATE decision-making framework is assessing whether we have the ability ‚Äì in other words, the knowledge, skills, resources, and belief in success ‚Äì to complete the action right now. If we're injured, we might need a resource to help us climb the stairs, such as a cane, a crutch, or a friend to carry our backpack. Or if we haven't been active lately, we might not believe ourselves capable of climbing multiple flights of stairs until we've mastered a smaller challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally the timing of a decision comes with a pressing external urgency. The decision of whether to do our taxes now or later comes with an April 15th deadline and penalties if we're late. However, most other actions can be put off until tomorrow. Even if we'd like to exercise more by taking the stairs, we might decide not to start today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur past experience with an action has a powerful impact on whether we'll have the confidence to try it again. If someone made fun of you for climbing the stairs too slowly, or if you've slipped on the stairs and gotten hurt, these negative experiences might make you reluctant to try it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's time for a workshop activity. A friend sent you an invite to Duolingo, and you've always wanted to learn a new language. Use the CREATE framework to analyze your decision making process on whether you download the app and get started today or not. \u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"behavioral-design-|-understanding-decision-making"},{"id":510753,"title":"üé¨ Behavioral Design | Influencing User Decisions","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.4 BEHAVIORAL DESIGN Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/774009188?h=c8a109e52e\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we understand the process users go through when making decisions, let's investigate how we can influence their choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's start this section with a reminder that behavioral design begins with the user. If the user doesn't want to change their behavior, we shouldn't manipulate them into changing or developing new habits against their will. If the user does want to change their behavior, however, the CREATE framework demonstrates that a lot can dissuade them from actually taking action. How can we remove obstacles that might prevent a user from making better decisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo design for behavior change, it's not enough to understand how the mind makes decisions. We need a process that helps us intervene when users are struggling to make the right decision. The DECIDE process is an acronym for a 6-step process that helps us decide what sort of intervention is appropriate for a specific user facing a specific situation. First we define the problem. Then we explore the context in which the problem occurs. Next we craft an intervention, implement the intervention within the product, and determine the impact. Finally, we evaluate the results and determine next steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to our example of a user who wishes to become more active by taking more steps per day, how might a fitness apps such as Fitbit use the DECIDE process to influence decision-making? Can a digital product help encourage users to choose the stairs instead of the elevator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen defining the problem, we start by identifying the audience and understanding what they want to achieve. People who want to get more active or take more steps per day are a rather broad audience. We might narrow that down to urban office workers who want more activity during their workday, since these are workers who often face the choice of using an elevator or the stairs. We should also define what success looks like. Is an average increase of three flights of stairs per day achievable? How long should it take for users to form this new habit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat stands in the way of users achieving their goals? While exploring the context, we gather data about the obstacles preventing users from changing their behavior. We can learn about user attitudes by surveying and interviewing them, and use contextual inquiry to observe their behavior. If we're a fitness application trying to encourage more physical activity during the workday,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe might also want to gather information about the relationship between office workers and their phones and smart watches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you gather data, you'll start to form groups of users based on their previous experiences. Some users will have tried fitness apps before and some won't. Some users will have negative associations with climbing stairs and some won't. These groupings are important because it's unlikely one solution will satisfy every type of persona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen crafting an intervention, choose a persona from your context-gathering stage, and come up with a hypothesis for intervening in that user's decision-making process. Then prototype an interface you can use to test that hypothesis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking of how to encourage users to take the stairs, our first instinct might be to cue the user with a well-timed push notification. However behavioral design tactics to motivate users should consider all six stages of the CREATE framework. Let's look at timing, for example. How can we motivate users to take the stairs now, rather than putting it off until later? One possibility might be notifying the user they're closing in on a goal. A user who realizes they're nearing 7,900 steps for the day might take the stairs to reach 8,000. What about ability and experience? How can we convince users who have struggled to build exercise habits that they're capable this time? \"Fresh start\" messaging can help ‚Äì that is, messaging that makes this journey feel special and past attempts feel irrelevant. In addition, some products use social proof: the idea that if your friends can meet behavior change goals, so can you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you've settled on an intervention, it's time to prototype and test. In addition to testing the effectiveness of the intervention, you'll want to assess the ethics of the solution. An ethical product is transparent about its purpose, doesn't harm users or cause them to grow addicted, and ensures all user actions are voluntary. That last reminder is a critical one. Behavioral design is ethical only when users want to change their behavior and can make informed decisions to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo test the impact of your intervention, make sure you're only conducting one experiment at a time. Then run an A/B test. Divide users at random into a control group, who see the old version of your product, versus a test group who experiences the new prototype. As with any test, make sure you've clearly defined what you're hoping to learn. You'll want a clear hypothesis stating the outcome your team is expecting to happen as well as metrics for defining success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any design process, the DECIDE process is an iterative one. If your intervention was successful, you might implement it as is, or continue to refine it to maximize its impact. On the other hand, many behavioral design interventions aren't successful. Making beneficial decisions is hard for users, and nudging users towards positive habits is hard for product designers. Be prepared to back up to previous stages in the DECIDE process frequently and run numerous experiments before settling on the right approach.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"behavioral-design-|-influencing-user-decisions"},{"id":510754,"title":"üé¨ Behavioral Design | Designing For Decision Making","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.4 BEHAVIORAL DESIGN Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/774009213?h=3d27f033f5\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kinds of design principles make decision-making easier for users?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile providing users with lots of options sounds great in theory, more choices isn't always better. In the year 2000, an upscale California food market increased its sales of gourmet jam by 27% by simply reducing the number of available flavors from 24 to 6. Too many choices overwhelm people, a phenomenon sometimes called analysis paralysis. As an example, think of the last time you struggled to find anything to watch on Netflix, despite having thousands of movies and shows to choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurated options especially help when people make decisions with health or financial consequences that can be stressful for users. Roobrik, a web app helping users consider assisted living options for loved ones needing care, helps limit analysis paralysis by only providing a few good options. After gathering information from the user about the loved one's needs and health, the app provides a few recommended options along with a clear rationale for why those choices might be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile your product might provide the option of an expert level experience for advanced users, everyday users don't want to be faced with a ton of detail when making decisions. Present high level categories and the most critical details first, then allow users to explore additional details on a separate screen or by uncollapsing a panel. The Weight Watchers app pictured here frees users from counting calories by bundling nutritional information into one metric, a daily point system. When entering meals, users are initially faced with only a few simple, instantly recognizable categories: veggies, water, breakfast, lunch, dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople don't always understand the consequences of a decision. By making the potential downside to a decision transparent, you'll inspire trust in your product and help users make more confident choices. While the Mint budgeting app recommends a method of debt reduction called the debt snowball, the approach is ineffective for users with high-interest debt. If the app didn't make this drawback obvious, users could easily select the wrong strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding user tendencies and biases can help designers nudge users towards a positive decision. For example, the anchoring bias means that people often estimate value by focusing on a single, initial piece of information. Designers can take advantage of this bias by implementing well-chosen default values. In 2015, the British nonprofit organization Oxfam saw a 23% increase in donations simply by adding a ¬£4 suggested default before its Donate Now call to action. This change reduces the decision burden on users. Instead of worrying what a reasonable donation might look like, they can accept or adjust the recommended value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunk cost fallacy means that people often continue investing in an activity because of past time, effort, or money sunk into the activity, even when the reward is no longer available. This is the tendency that keeps us waiting for a bus that's 20 minutes late rather than searching for alternate transportation. When apps such as Duolingo reward user streaks, in addition to providing a positive feeling, it reminds the user they don't want to waste their accumulated time investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion. Developing new, positive habits is a lengthy process for users.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing information design. So how do we define information design? To quote author and information designer Joel Katz, our job as information designers is to clarify, to simplify, and to make information accessible to the people who will need it and use it to make important decisions. Information needs to be in a form they can understand and use meaningfully, and to tell the truth of what things mean and how they work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, information design is concerned with making complex information easier to understand and use. It emerged as a response to people's need to understand and use technical information as well as computer interfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation design combines the unique disciplines of typography, graphic design, linguistics, psychology, ergonomics, and computing. When users are faced with a complex task, your job as a designer is to make it as clear and simple as possible. While this can be achieved in a variety of ways, it's critical above all to understand the user's mental model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat factors shape the way users understand the information in front of them? You can also assist users by using plain, understandable language, by carefully labeling interface elements, and by reducing visual chaos by using grids On the screen in front of us, we see a Venn diagram visualizing the overlapping components of information design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuccessful information design is found at the intersection of data, visual graphics, and narrative storytelling.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"information-design-|-what-is-information-design"},{"id":501812,"title":"üé¨ Information Design | Data vs. Information","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.1 INFORMATION DESIGN Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765854981?h=a0c24c242c\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre data and information the same thing? And if not, what makes them different? Let's find out. In this example, we see a spreadsheet full of sales records. One table is labeled Sales and another is labeled Quota. Is this data meaningful to you? Or how about this example? This time we see assorted figures related to different United States counties for the year 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you learn from scanning the figures? Are you able to interpret the data from reading it? If the last two slides didn't mean much of anything, you're not alone. Data without context, labels, or organization is meaningless. When designers add context and organization to data, they convert that data into information\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat can be used and acted upon by the viewer. Converting data into information starts with grouping related data and providing meaningful labels so viewers can understand what they're seeing and quickly find what they're looking for. If your data is interactive, it helps to provide filters so viewers can isolate the data most meaningful to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also highlight trends or averages within the data, if that helps the viewer understand it faster. According to a 2009 report by the University of California, San Diego, the average American consumes 34 gigabytes of data each day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're having trouble visualizing what 34 gigabytes looks like, well, that's exactly my point. Data only truly becomes valuable when it is structured and actionable. Cognitive overload happens all too easily on the web. The more we ask users to do the hard work of converting data into information, the harder it becomes for them to make a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling attention to what's important within a set of information reduces fatigue and leads to better informed choices. On the screen, we see two dates in November 2020 that at a glance look pretty similar to each other. The column on the left features the dates alone. What do you learn from this column?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you said, not much, I'm inclined to agree with you. In the column on the right, each data is supported by a bit of colorful text. What do you learn from this column? Here we see that whatever it was that was due on November 6th is now one day overdue, while whatever was due on November 10th isn't due for three more days. In this case, it was a pretty subtle change that turned unprocessed data into actionable information.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"information-design-|-data-vs-information"},{"id":501816,"title":" üé¨ Information Design | Information Design as a Task","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.1 INFORMATION DESIGN Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765854963?h=ba1dba89fb\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kinds of projects does an information designer work on, and how does an information designer know when to take action? The more complex the information being presented, the harder the information designer will need to work to simplify the presentation and allow the user to make meaningful, informed decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are some tasks information designers might take on? Online forms are notoriously difficult for users of all abilities to complete. Information designers help by breaking the form into discrete steps and minimizing, wherever possible, the number of fields users are required to fill out. Learning portals offer interactive online learning. Information\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edesigners can help organize and present information appropriate to what the user is trying to learn and for the user's current level of understanding. When designing annual reports, it's important to understand what leadership is looking to learn from the reports and what readers want to know about the health or expansion of the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for service blueprints, these are extensions of customer journey maps that align to a business goal, such as reducing redundancies or improving the employee experience. Finally, infographics are charts or diagrams used to reduce data complexity and share information visually. An information designer makes the complex simpler by removing unnecessary information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis often means embracing a progressive disclosure approach. Progressive disclosure sequences information and tasks across multiple screens. Start by placing the information most vital to your user in front of them. Then allow them to dig deeper with a click or a tap. On screen, we have two examples of instructions for taking medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat techniques have been used to improve user understanding in the version on the right? Why is this important?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion. Is there a link between information design and user experience?

The conversion of data into information provides just the foundation for this visual known as the DIKW or data, information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid. We've done our job as information designers when users can convert that information into knowledge, meaning they can use it to make decisions. Even better, that knowledge can bring wisdom, or the ability to apply knowledge to real life situations and predict future outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we see a site map diagram for an informational website. Information architecture helps structure information and makes users more confident in the actions they take when locating information within a system. A customer journey map helps you design information with the user's mental model in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding around user pain points minimizes confusion and keeps users moving towards a goal. This user journey map shows how a person interacts with a brand or product over time and through different channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote the influence of empathy mapping here. At each stage in the journey, we should be aware of what the user thinks and feels and what motivates each action. The more you practice information design, the better you'll get at applying its principles to every asset you create as a designer. Whether you're communicating with users, teammates, or stakeholders, and whether you're designing body text, a set of data from a spreadsheet, or a diagram indicating a journey from start to finish, you'll want to make sure everything you design provides information, knowledge, and wisdom to your audience.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"information-design-|-information-design-as-a-mindset"},{"id":501825,"title":"üé¨ Information Design | Practicing Information Design","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.1 INFORMATION DESIGN Part 05_\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765854946?h=8fce11860d\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn what ways can you begin applying what you've learned to your information design practice?

In this series of lectures, we'll be discussing information design ethics. Let's start with protecting the user's right to access information. In the words of author, instructor, and communication designer, Jorge Frascara, access to information should be regarded as a human right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation design should not be seen as an option, but a necessity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could use this slide as a checklist to measure the respectfulness of your information design. Information design respects people when it focuses on user needs, when it's ethical and practical, when it's been made accessible for all types of users, when it's been designed attractively, and when it's relevant to the user's area of interest.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe information we provide should be readable, understandable, complete, accurate, timely, and usable. We should consider how people interact with our designs and double check that we didn't confuse, harm, or mislead the user, but that we instead provided straightforward information that could be used to inform decision-making.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pyramid on screen demonstrates that while delighting the user is important, it's only the capstone of a respectful experience. The foundation of the respectful design pyramid is human rights and it depends on protecting user privacy and security, being open and honest, meeting accessibility requirements, and designing products that are environmentally sustainable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the foundation of the pyramid we see a level labeled human effort, which speaks to minimizing the effort users need to access our information. The products and services we design should be functional, convenient, and reliable. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"information-design-ethics-|-information-as-a-right"},{"id":501865,"title":"üé¨ Information Design Ethics | PAPA ","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.2 INFORMATION DESIGN ETHICS Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765861375?h=866bd791e8\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this section of our lecture on information design ethics, we'll be discussing an ethical framework called PAPA. In 1986, an author and ethics professor named Richard Mason proposed the PAPA framework to address four ethical issues society would likely face in the information age: privacy, accuracy, property, and accessibility.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Papa framework asks questions every responsible information designer needs to be able to answer, such as what things can people keep to themselves and not be forced to reveal to others? Who is responsible for the authenticity, fidelity and accuracy of information?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho owns information as well as the channels through which information is transmitted? And what information does a person or an organization have the right to obtain?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 2018 General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR protects the personal data of European Union citizens, including their name, address, location, health information, and cultural profile. Organizations are required to be transparent about data collected, to collect only as much data as is necessary,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand to store it for only as long as it's needed. Businesses must also protect the security of user data, and make their data collection policies transparent to the user. California passed a similar law later the same year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a question for discussion. Doctors and lawyers both commit to upholding a code of ethics, and a serious enough violation can result in a loss of the license to practice medicine or law. Do you think designers should be held to a similar standard?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Mike Monteiro, the co-founder and design director of Mule Design, published an influential essay called A Designer's Code of Ethics in which he states when we knowingly produce work that is intended to harm, we are abdicating our responsibility. When we ignorantly produce work that harms others because we didn't consider the full ramifications of that work, we are doubly guilty.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudies show that graphic warning labels on cigarette packs increase the likelihood of quitting tobacco, as the warnings provide behavioral nudges to remind smokers about the health risks associated with smoking. Attempting to increase profits for your stakeholder does not mean designers can overlook user safety.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating ethical designs means presenting a complete set of information upfront and letting users make their own judgment based on that information.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about how much data your devices collect about your habits. Did your apps provide a warning as to how your data would be used? Did you consent to having your data collected? Are you confident your data will be kept private and secure? Do you believe any of your data could be used unethically against you?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, Uber paid a $148 million settlement due to its poor data privacy practices. Uber employees were allowed unlimited access to customer data, and hackers were able to steal the personal information of 25 million customers and drivers. In addition, Uber used an internal software program called Greyball to hide driver location and ride sharing information from government officials trying to enforce local taxi laws.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for another discussion question. As a designer, how can you follow your own moral and ethical codes that might not always align with the practices of the company you work for? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"information-design-ethics-|-papa"},{"id":501876,"title":"üé¨ Information Design Ethics | Consumption of Information","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.2 INFORMATION DESIGN ETHICS Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765864066?h=8648ebca02\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's talk about how today's users consume information. We'll start with two quotes from very different sources. The first is from political scientist Herbert A. Simon, who says what information consumes is rather obvious. It consumes the attention of its recipients. The second is from singer Tom Waits, who says we are buried beneath the weight of information, which is being confused with knowledge;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equantity is being confused with abundance and wealth with happiness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a 2012 book by Clay A. Johnson called The Information Diet, users spend 11 out of every 24 hours consuming information. This includes traditional media sources such as television, newspapers, and magazines, but also websites, social media feeds, and text and instant messaging. To quote the author, \"just as too much junk food can lead to obesity, too much junk information can lead to cluelessness\".\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what can users do to filter out empty, meaningless data and find nutritious, useful information?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat motivates the way people consume information? Sometimes we seek information to help us solve a problem or make a decision. Information consumption has a social aspect as well, as we want to appear knowledgeable and share information that supports our point of view with our peers. And of course, curiosity plays a role as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe might desire knowledge for the sake of knowledge, but we might also be tempted to respond to clickbait, a term describing a sensationalized headline or article snippet designed to draw attention. Or sometimes we're acting unconsciously to trigger the dopamine release that accompanies refreshing a newsfeed or performing an action inspired by a notification on our phones.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilter bubbles can make your views feel more universally accepted and less disputed than they are in reality. For example, a video sharing app may suggest videos that align favorably with your political viewpoint. Your social media network of friends who share your beliefs can similarly create an artificial echo chamber of data that confirms your existing point of view.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes work for users to verify the correctness of online information and identify sources that are reliable, reputable, and trustworthy. Consuming misinformation can give users a distorted worldview and lead to flawed decision-making.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his book The Information Diet, author Clay A. Johnson argues that while overwhelming the user with information leads to shortened attention spans and shallower social relationships, \"information overload\" is the wrong term because it blames the information. Johnson prefers the term \"overconsumption\", which means users need to manage how they consume information daily.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think? How much control do users have over information consumption?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnscreen we see a 2018 screenshot of the unsubscribe process from Daily Yahoo. The wording is lengthy, and the call to action actually cancels the unsubscription process. Which brings up some followup questions. Do users always understand the data consumption options in front of them? Can designers help reduce information overconsumption?

So while data visualization involves some of the same skills as information design, it also requires being able to analyze data to find meaning. Data analysis is more of an exploratory art and tends to come first in the data visualization process before the more explanatory art of information design.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo are infographics synonymous with data visualization? According to product designer Valina Chan, not quite. Infographics are subjective, telling a premeditated story to guide the audience to conclusions.

Are we ready to begin designing? Not yet. Let's examine the process designers go through when approaching a data visualization. Before you begin designing, you need to know who you're designing for. How familiar is your audience with your topic?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat decisions are your audience responsible for making? Are they comfortable with a complex chart, or will they need a simple presentation? Do they need precise numbers or just a general idea of an overall trend? Also, consider the context in which your audience will encounter your visual. Is it part of a presentation or will they be able to interact with the data and apply filters?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext decide on the story you need to tell. Remember, more data isn't always better. Figure out what your audience needs to know and how you want them to respond after encountering your visualization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's look at some examples. In 2014, the Washington Post created an online visual colored by a gradient from light to dark blue that required a ton of vertical scrolling to view as it was nearly 17,000 pixels tall. Why? Officials were searching for the wreckage of a missing Malaysian airliner some 15,000 feet beneath the surface of the ocean. Since most people can't visualize what 15,000 feet looks like, the visual tells the story, \"how deep is the ocean?\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, the website 538 used a scatter plot to diagram California's annual precipitation and average temperature from 1895 to 2018. Why? To answer the question, \"is California getting hotter and drier?\" While the dots representing 1895 to 1999 are scattered at random. The dots representing 2000 through 2018 clearly trend towards hot and dry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData journalist Mona Chalabi created a bar chart using various sizes of folded up $1 bills. Why? To tell a story of income inequality. For every $1 a white man earns, Native American and Hispanic women earn less than 60 cents.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third step in preparing to visualize a set of data is to double-check it. If you didn't gather your own data, you need to check where it came from. In Chalabi's case, she used the 2015 United States census report. If you can't find the original source of your data, if you're uncertain of the trustworthiness of the source, or if you're not sure what methods were used to gather the data, don't use it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you're certain you're working with trustworthy data, you need to choose just the right amount. Faced with a table of data, it might be tempting to use all of it A visual representing income inequality in the United States could include the number of children in each family, for example, as that information is available in the census report. But would that information have helped tell a clear story? Or just cluttered the visualization?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you know your audience, decide on your story, double-check and prepare your data, you'll finally be ready to select the most meaningful and appropriate chart or graphic.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhen you encounter a data visualization, how do you decide whether or not to trust it?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eHow can designers make sure the audience trusts their visualizations? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"data-visualization-|-data-visualization-process"},{"id":501902,"title":"üé¨ Data Visualization | Types of Visualizations","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Data Visualization | Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765864026?h=5db41846fc\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you might imagine, there are many types of visualizations to choose from. What considerations do designers use to select one?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in picking the right visualization is knowing who your audience is and what knowledge they already have. If your topic is baseball, for example, you would design differently for hardcore, stat-obsessed fantasy players than you would for casual fans who only tune in for the World Series.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, you need to decide what story you want to tell your audience and what question your audience might have in mind that your visualization is intended to answer. With that in mind, let's look at some different chart types.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBar graphs show comparisons between different categories of data. If the four employees of my company respectively sold $400, $700, $500, and $1000 worth of goods this month, I could use a bar graph like the one on the left to compare their performances. When labeling the numeric axis of a bar graph, which in this case would be sales amounts in dollars, always start the axis at zero. Otherwise you risk distorting the comparison being made. Line graphs, on the other hand, show changes in data over time. If my team sold 20 units in January, 40 in February, 35 in March, 45 in April, and 65 in May, I could visualize my team's performance over these five months using a line graph like the one on the right. Unlike bar graphs, line graphs sometimes label a numeric axis starting with a number other than zero. It depends on what's appropriate for the type of data you're using.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScatter plots help users understand the correlation, or strength of relationship, between two different variables. If I were making paper airplanes and wanted to determine whether there was a relationship between the weight of the paper and the distance the airplane traveled, I could chart each paper airplane's weight and performance on a scatter plot.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter diagramming the data, I would analyze the correlation between the variables. Looking at the scatter plot on the left, I would say the relationship is positive, since the dots create a path from the lower left to the upper right, and linear, since they form a straight line rather than a curved one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe correlation is somewhat weak, however, since lots of dots are outliers, meaning they don't follow the general pattern. A flow chart as seen on the right is a diagram that shows a step-by-step progression through a system or process.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePie charts show percentages of a whole. If 60% of my class got an A this term, 25% got a B, 10% got a C, and 5% got a D, I could visualize class performance using a pie chart, like the one on the left. Just make sure your numbers add up to 100%. When working with small sets of data, you can use pictogram charts, also known as pictographs, such as the one on the right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePictographs reduce the amount of reading by using icons to represent data. If one of my employees sold 4 cars today and another sold 2, I could represent their performance by using 4 and 2 car icons, respectively. Pictographs don't work well with large data sets, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenn diagrams use overlapping circles to represent the relationship between sets of data. A Gantt chart is a unique type of bar chart depicting a project schedule from start to finish.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHierarchy diagrams show hierarchical relationships progressing from top to bottom. These might be used to show the structure of a business organization, with a CEO at the top and upper management at the next level. Hierarchical diagrams also feature in information architecture in the form of site map diagrams.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaps help users visualize distribution, location, and impact of data in a geographic environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many other types of visualizations not listed here. And you'll encounter others as you learn more about data visualization. The important thing to remember is don't select your visualization type first. Figure out what you want your audience to know, and how you'd like them to respond after viewing your visualization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen make your choice from there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for best practices while making your visualization, always keep your specific audience in mind. Create visual hierarchy to draw attention to the most important information, and label your visualization clearly. Aim for simplicity and conciseness, which also means only including the data you absolutely need to tell your story.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd do provide hierarchy, context, and contrast with your color choice. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"data-visualization-|-types-of-visualizations"},{"id":501903,"title":"üé¨ Data Visualization | Accessible Visualizations","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Data Visualization | Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765864002?h=e9cab40e17\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo data visualizations have their own considerations when it comes to creating an accessible experience? Let's find out. As much as possible, use plain language when labeling your charts. When using industry-specific terminology, make sure that the terms you use are essential to understanding the data and appropriate for your audience's level of knowledge.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure the labels you create for your chart are clear, easy to read, and do an obvious job of labeling data points. Here we see a clearly labeled chart illustrating the effectiveness of Calls To Action within an email campaign in a particular week.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe X axis is labeled based on the date, while the Y axis is labeled based on how many thousands of clicks each Call To Action received. The chart also has a legend indicating the blue line on the graph represents new accounts opened, and the green line represents unsubscriptions. So that's effective labeling.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet I see a potential accessibility issue still lingering. Can you spot it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's an award-winning visualization called The Daily Routines of Famous Creative People. The labeling looks clear enough. We see the 24 hours of the day, as well as the sleep and creative work habits of a number of authors, musicians, and artists.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, I still believe there's an accessibility issue. Can you find it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you mentioned color, great job. When applying color to data visualizations designers need to follow two rules. Don't rely on color alone to provide meaning. And do use sufficient color contrast. Each of the previous two charts relied solely on color to convey information.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnscreen we see two charts as viewed using colorblindness simulators. In the top chart, labeling the bars of the graph directly helps audiences who can't distinguish between the colors of the bars. In the pie chart at the bottom, a thin white separator aids viewers who can't distinguish between the low contrast colors used to color slices of the pie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if users can't see your chart? Partner with developers to write an effective alt description that at the very least lists the type of the chart, describes the story being told by the data, and explains the reason for including the chart. Linking users to the original data source has two benefits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes your chart feel more trustworthy, and it provides an additional resource for audiences who can't see your chart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a chart from the New York Times from 2015 labeled gun murders per 100,000 people. Our alt text might read, \"bar chart of gun murders per 100,000 people where America's murder rate is six times worse than Canada and 30 times Australia\".\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat is the greatest challenge designers face when creating accessible visualizations?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat specific steps can designers take to make sure their charts are accessible? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"data-visualization-|-accessible-visualizations"},{"id":447927,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 11.3 Data Visualization","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":"must_submit","completed":true,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lab-graphik.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-heading=\"Overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTo complete this assignment, follow the instructions for üî¨\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLab: 11.3 Data Visualization\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003ein Figma.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e","exportId":"g6f93f712167785b9f095077de8bfc807"},{"id":447928,"title":"üìö Resources: Data Visualization","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat Is Data Visualization?

My name is Anwar and I'm part of the Product Design curriculum team here at Flatiron School. In this series of lectures we'll be discussing designing dashboards.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what is a dashboard? According to Stephen Few, author of a book called Information Dashboard Design, a dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's an example. The YouTube studio dashboard brings up the most meaningful creator stats at a glance, including watch time, views, subscribers, top videos, and latest activity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat dashboards communicate information quickly, display information clearly and efficiently, show trends and changes in data over time, and are easily customizable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen designing a dashboard, it's impossible to make all the data a user could possibly need available upfront. Instead, it's critical to identify the most important information and create a clear visual hierarchy to make that information understandable, meaningful, and usable. Provide additional links and filters so users have the opportunity to drill down for more details. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-what-is-a-dashboard"},{"id":501957,"title":" üé¨ Designing Dashboards | Types of Dashboards","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Designing Dashboards | Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765863975?h=a3e5cf5112\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Not every dashboard serves the same function. Let's take a look at different types of dashboards. Operational dashboards are the most traditional and commonly used type of dashboard, presenting real time data of daily business operations. The main purpose of operational dashboards is to keep track of and evaluate how well ongoing processes and short-term operations are working.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn analytical dashboard presents data trends over time to help users make better decisions about the future. \u0026nbsp;While the initial view of an analytical dashboard tends to show data over months, quarters, or years, analytical dashboards are also typically highly interactive to enable deeper analysis. Analytical dashboards supply a business with a comprehensive overview of its data operations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrategic dashboards let the user track their main strategic goals via KPIs, or key performance indicators, as well as OKRs, or objectives and key results. Strategic dashboards are often used to compare the performance of individual departments against an overall longterm strategy and do so by comparing the current working period against past performance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether the dashboard you're designing is an operational, analytical, or strategic dashboard, you'll want to make sure your dashboard can adapt to the needs of the person using it. Two ways to do so are through personalization and customization. While these two terms sound similar, personalization describes content and functionality that matches specific user needs or interests with no effort from the user.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a dashboard uses geolocation to present information relevant to a user's current location, or adapts the display of information based on the user's role or previous activity, the system would be automatically personalizing the user's experience. Customization, on the other hand, is performed by the user.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a customized experience, the user can choose what they want to see, or set preferences for how information is organized or displayed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat information would you need from users to determine the right type of dashboard to design?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat methods would you use to determine the ideal mix of presentation and customization options? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-types-of-dashboards"},{"id":501959,"title":"üé¨ Designing Dashboards | Dashboards \u0026 Data Storytelling","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Designing Dashboards | Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765863958?h=757e951097\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the connection between dashboard design and data storytelling? Let's find out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDashboards are a form of data communication. Data storytelling is a collection of skills and concepts that help improve data communication. To be effective, a dashboard needs to communicate clearly to its intended audience. It needs to be clear, concise, engaging, and organized. Dashboard should provide a consistent view of key metrics and trends that are important to the audience and should reflect the audience's priorities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelling an effective story with data using a dashboard can feel structurally similar to composing a three act play. We start by setting context. What can the audience learn from this data? Why is this meaningful? And why is this information credible? Next comes the heart of the story. The audience may need to be guided through the data to find insights relevant to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally during the resolution, the audience takes action. This could be a direct action, something that can be done right now based on the data. Or it might be an indirect action, in which the data helps the user make better decisions in the future.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, storytelling means more than just presenting data. Dashboards should set a context to explain why a chart is relevant, describe the chart so users can understand how to interpret it, guide the flow so users understand how to move forward, and highlight insights and actions so users remember key takeaways and have enough information to make thoughtful decisions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe individual metrics presented by your dashboard are the characters in your story. Deciding which metrics to emphasize in a data story can be complex, but the decision should be made based on the needs and priorities of your audience. Displaying only a few metrics at a time makes your story easier to understand, and makes it easier for your audience to identify the heroes or villains‚Äìthat is, the good or bad data points based on the user's strategic goals.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat visual storytelling components could you use in your dashboard to make the story accessible to people outside of your organization? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-dashboards-and-data-storytelling"},{"id":501962,"title":" üé¨ Designing Dashboards | Dashboard Design Pitfalls","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Designing Dashboards | Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765863939?h=5225f90bbb\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat pitfalls should designers avoid when creating dashboards? When designing dashboards, marketing strategist Eleanor Taylor says the challenge is not to add new features, but to add value and power to products without adding any complexity. In other words, don't add features just to have them. \u0026nbsp;Calculate the value each feature offers the user, and whether you're helping users answer key questions and navigate data to find meaning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you've heard of the five second test, a rapid usability test in which participants are given only five seconds to view a design before answering questions about what they remember. This technique measures how quickly a design communicates a message. If users can't remember how their most important metrics are performing after viewing your dashboard for five seconds, that's a good indication you've made it too cluttered.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse caution when adding animations and 3D effects to your dashboard visualizations. Motion should be purposeful, indicating a direction of change or leading users towards the answer to their question. 3D effects should be applied sparingly, if at all, as they can make charts harder to read and distort comparisons within datasets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColor should also be applied purposefully. Too many colors creates visual noise and makes your content hard to read and understand. Also, as with any data visualization, avoid relying on color alone to communicate meaning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile designers should strive for a clean dashboard layout with plenty of white space and effective visual hierarchy, be aware of making your design so minimal that your information lacks context. Users need enough labels to find meaning and spot trends in the data, as well as to indicate what their interactive options are on each screen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as with any visual design, you can't make everything on a dashboard screen important. Guide the user's eye to key information. Embrace progressive disclosure: reserve less important information and advanced features for secondary screens.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLack of contrast will lead to users struggling to accurately interpret the information in front of them. While you'll want to make sure your colors meet contrast standards outlined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, you'll also need to make sure you've applied contrast meaningfully to your design so users don't miss the point of your visual. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-dashboard-design-pitfalls"},{"id":447937,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 11.4 Designing Dashboards","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":"must_submit","completed":true,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem;

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing storytelling and presenting. Let's start with storytelling 101. Fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson says that the purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Which is an interesting way to look at storytelling,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut how can we apply that idea to design presentations? Let's start with a discussion prompt. How do you define an effective story?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we need to recognize that design presentations are meant to be customized based on your understanding of your audience. Who is your audience? Are they stakeholders? Designers? Engineers? Or a mixture? What is important to them? What knowledge level do they bring to your presentation? When presentations fall flat, it's because the presenter didn't compel the audience to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdd drama by approaching your presentation as a narrative. Make the problem you were trying to solve immediately clear. Highlight the challenges you overcame, and reach a memorable conclusion. When building your presentation as a story, emphasize conflict. What pain points faced the user? What challenges stood in your way as you attempted to define the problem, alleviate pain points, or test a solution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a sense of continuity in your narrative using foreshadowing and echoing techniques. Foreshadowing gives an indication or hint of something important happening later in the story, while echoing means referring back to a lesson learned earlier. Transitions link one piece of the story to the next and keep the audience eager to learn what's coming on the next set of slides. Think of your favorite action or suspense novel. Each chapter ends with an unanswered question, making it hard for the reader to put the book down until they've discovered the answer. \"Show, don't tell\" is common storytelling advice. Instead of explaining what happened, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, visuals, and appeals to the reader's emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep the number of words per slide to a minimum, and instead choose the graphics, charts, user quotes, and verbal anecdotes that will tell the same story, but more vividly. Common storytelling techniques include the hero's journey or monomyth in which an adventurer goes on a journey, overcomes a crisis, and returns home changed or transformed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one reason why many design presentations end with what the designer would do differently next time based on what they learned from this project. The converging ideas method shows the audience how different approaches or ways of thinking ultimately merge to form one single, stronger idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA false start story is when you begin to tell a seemingly predictable story before unexpectedly disrupting it and beginning all over again. This might happen when an insight uncovered during research or user testing led to a total change in project direction. In medias res is a technique for beginning a narrative in the heat of the action before returning to the beginning and explaining how you got there. Used appropriately, this can hook your audience from the beginning. Just be careful not to reveal too much of the project's conclusion too early. In medias res works best when beginning shorter presentations, as taking too long to return to the crisis point can frustrate your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"storytelling-and-presenting-|-storytelling-101"},{"id":501988,"title":"üé¨ Storytelling and Presenting | Creating a Presentation","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.1 INTRO TO STORYTELLING AND PRESENTING Part 2\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/766167585?h=6183dfc2fd\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat goes into an effective presentation? Let's find out. Author and motivational speaker Lily Walters says the success of your presentation will be judged not by the knowledge you send, but by what the listener receives. In other words, simply documenting a successful design project isn't enough.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to convince your audience your work matters to them, and deliver your most important insights in a way they'll remember later.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we look at some common components of an effective presentation, here's another discussion prompt. What makes a presentation compelling? Is your answer different for online presentations versus when you're in the room with the speaker?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's discuss what goes into an effective presentation. You'll want to use your early slides to let your audience know what you're presenting and why your presentation matters to them. What was your role? Who worked with you? What was the main problem you were trying to solve? As you move forward, explain the design process you took your project through, including the motivation for each step. Summarize key insights learned at each stage using a combination of prominent text, numbers, iconography, and visuals so the audience doesn't have to struggle to understand what's important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, conclude your presentation with the single most important takeaway. Include what you've learned and where you'd like the project to head next.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you design your slides, keep the number of words per slide to a minimum. Apple CEO Steve Jobs famously rehearsed his presentations so thoroughly that his slides often consisted of a single word or a single visual. If your audience is busy reading your slides, they're probably not listening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesigning visually compelling slides isn't enough on its own. A conversational tone keeps the audience engaged. Just as you can stress important takeaways visually, you can do the same with your voice. Now bear in mind that sounding both conversational and authoritative isn't something that comes naturally for most people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more you rehearse your presentation beforehand, the more confident you'll feel and sound. Finally, allow time for audience questions at the end, and do your best to anticipate questions your audience might ask you as part of your preparation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you explain your design process, keep in mind the level of knowledge your audience brings to the presentation. A room full of designers will recognize common design deliverables, so there's no need to define them. Just jump right in to why you did what you did and what you learned. Stakeholders, on the other hand, might need a bit more background information. And developers will be interested to hear your thoughts on implementing your designs, and whether you've kept technological feasibility in mind.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't forget the story you tell should constantly reinforce the reason you're giving the presentation. Are you sharing your vision? Educating the audience? Reporting on your progress? Trying to persuade your audience to follow a particular direction? Don't get so caught up in small details that your audience loses track of the big picture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, remember to respect your audience's attention span. Make sure your presentation is designed for the time slot you've been given and doesn't go over time. Vary your presentation methods a bit by saying more about some slides and less about others. Build in checks for understanding by asking questions of your audience or allowing them opportunities to participate. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"storytelling-and-presenting-|-creating-a-presentation"},{"id":501992,"title":"üé¨ Storytelling and Presenting | Designing Your Slides","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.1 INTRO TO STORYTELLING AND PRESENTING Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/766167618?h=343989a5f5\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's talk about strategies for designing your slides. The slide on the left contains far too many words. Don't forget our storytelling advice: show, don't tell. If your topic is the glorious rings of Saturn, including a recognizable photo of Saturn allows you to remove a ton of text.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is also a reminder of the benefits of a well-rehearsed presentation. The more confident you feel about how you're going to describe each slide verbally, the fewer words you'll need on screen. Here we've removed even more text by identifying the most important takeaways within the body copy and visualized them using large text and iconography.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if your audience ignores the body text, the bold heading and highlighted key points give them plenty to remember.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember the five second test? Try it with the slide on the left. I'd be surprised if you remember much of anything after five seconds, apart from the photo of the planet Venus. The designer hasn't done the work to determine what information is most important,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand has instead placed the burden on the viewer. How about the same five second test with the slide on the right? Cutting away irrelevant data and providing a visualization with big bold numbers makes the information far easier to recall.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two slides contain the same information presented in roughly the same way, but it's much easier to read the slide on the right thanks to the generous white space. White space reduces visual tension and allows the viewer the opportunity to concentrate on one visual at a time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Creating transitions between sections of your presentation with a big, bold visual is helpful for a number of reasons. This technique captures attention while at the same time allowing both the audience and the presenter a few seconds to catch their breath before diving into a new set of information.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarying your slide layouts also keeps your presentation from growing too dull or repetitive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you design your slides, be thinking about how your audience will receive your presentation. Audiences for virtual presentations using video conferencing software generally have shorter attention spans and face more distractions than in-person audiences. On the other hand, if your presentation is being sent directly to your audience, meaning you won't be there to provide verbal context, you'll have to make each slide just a bit wordier so the slides can speak for themselves. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"storytelling-and-presenting-|-designing-your-slides"},{"id":447942,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 12.1 Storytelling and Presenting","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":"must_submit","completed":true,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lab-graphik.png\" alt=\"DLab header graphic\" width=\"800\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003ch2 data-heading=\"Overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eTo complete this assignment, follow the instructions for \u003cstrong\u003eüî¨Lab: 12.1 Storytelling and Presenting\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003ein Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e","exportId":"g92ad668f830387188a38f0b6ce596a82"},{"id":447943,"title":"üìö Resources: Intro to Storytelling and Presenting","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/storytelling\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat is Storytelling?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persuasive-storytelling/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e6 Rules for Persuasive Storytelling\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/why-use-storytelling-ux-design-portfolio-presentation/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhy You Should Use Storytelling In UX Portfolio Presentations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.toptal.com/designers/brand/presentation-design-tips\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePresentation Design and the Art of Visual Storytelling\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e","exportId":"resources-intro-to-storytelling-and-presenting"}]},{"id":46329,"name":"12.2 Presenting Research","status":"completed","unlockDate":null,"prereqs":[46294],"requirement":"all","sequential":false,"exportId":"gf02dbdae581f2c70068c688b9bed4977","items":[{"id":447944,"title":"Presenting Research Insights","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eAvoid sharing raw data\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eResearch is an indispensable part of the product design process.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing presenting research. Let's start by examining why presenting the results from your research is valuable. UX researcher Nikki Anderson says it doesn't matter how good the findings are if you aren't able to communicate them effectively with your team. From learning about data visualization, you might recall that data‚Äìin other words, raw, unorganized facts and numbers‚Äìis useless until you provide it with context, organization, and a purpose.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same is true when presenting to team members and stakeholders. Until you convert your research findings into actionable information, your raw data lacks value.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you provide raw data, when your presentation is too lengthy or too disorganized, or when your findings aren't obvious and actionable, your research gets ignored.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what does an actionable research presentation consist of? First of all, reminding stakeholders of why the research was conducted gives context to your data. What were you hoping to find? What value does this research project provide to the business?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore starting a research project, you should have a clear hypothesis or testable assumption in mind about what you're expecting to happen. When presenting the results of your research, remind your audience about the assumptions made about target users. Did your research project confirm or contradict these assumptions?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour research presentation should include a brief description of the methods used to collect your data. How many users did you interview or observe? What were the pros and cons of each method? Keep this portion of your presentation concise and appropriate to your audience. Stakeholders don't need to hear every last detail of your research methodology,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust enough to get a sense of the thoroughness and effectiveness of your approach.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost importantly, never present all the data you've gathered, as this wastes the audience's time and your energy. \u0026nbsp;Instead, highlight the findings that will matter most to your audience and inspire meaningful action.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen highlighting key insights from your research data, apply the same principles as you would to any data visualization. Look for patterns in the data and call attention to the insights that are most relevant to the problems facing the business and the user. Present big bold takeaways designed to have a maximum impact on decision-making, even if that decision is to conduct additional research.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat are some effective ways to make sure the research findings you present align with your audience's interests?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWould your answer change depending on who is in your audience? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e","exportId":"presenting-research-|-value-of-presenting-research"},{"id":502020,"title":" üé¨ Presenting Research | Sharing Research Findings","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.2 PRESENTING RESEARCH Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/766167567?h=9311d8d2f3\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's take a closer look at some best practices for sharing research findings. You'll want to get started by providing context for your audience by reminding them of the following. Who participated in this research project? When did the research occur? Why does this research matter right now? What were we hoping to learn?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefer back to this final question‚Äìwhat were we hoping to learn‚Äìfrequently. Any research data that isn't relevant to the project goal should be left out of your presentation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, briefly summarize your team's research methodology. Take a moment to remind your audience of what research activities took place, why these methods were chosen, how they were conducted, and who participated. When planning your next research project, by the way, don't forget the value of participatory design.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;If it's possible to bring stakeholders to research activities, or even invite their participation, they'll feel engaged and offer feedback along the way.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen presenting relevant data, command attention with big, bold facts and figures that are easy to read and easy to remember. \u0026nbsp;Then provide pertinent details or evidence to support your main points. The data you highlight should be connected back to your original hypothesis and should shine a spotlight on recurring trends and themes. Visualize data so your audience can make sense of it quickly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting users state insights in their own words is often more powerful than stating them yourself. You can include user quotes in your presentation, or even short videos from research sessions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;In fact, one method of sharing insights called Atomic Research insists on pairing every insight with a short video of a target user talking about or demonstrating the experience. In Atomic Research, reports and slide decks are replaced with individual insights called nuggets that are linked to supporting video evidence and tagged by category.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour user research efforts may produce a variety of deliverables, including a competitive analysis, personas, user journey maps, affinity diagrams, and storyboards. However, these deliverables don't all need to be in your presentation. Before deciding to include a research artifact, remind yourself of who your audience is and what they want to know.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the deliverable doesn't help your audience understand the user, or the product, or the problem statement, leave it out. Include a brief summary of the findings instead.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen concluding your presentation, circle back to your original set of questions. Did your team learn what it needed to? Of your testable assumptions, which were validated, and which were invalidated? In addition, include suggestions for what should happen next. How might this research impact future decision-making?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs additional research needed?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're wondering whether it's okay to admit shortcomings of your research project, the answer is yes. All user research methods have potential drawbacks. If your research took place remotely, for example, you might have a limited understanding of the participant's use context. Be honest about what you didn't learn,\u0026nbsp;as stakeholders are more inclined to trust you when you are completely transparent. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-research-|-sharing-research-findings"},{"id":502023,"title":"üé¨ Presenting Research | What to do","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.2 PRESENTING RESEARCH Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/766167600?h=1ba7d11474\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's take a look at a few example slides, starting with suggestions of what to do when designing a user research presentation. Do call out key quantitative data and emphasize its correlation with qualitative data.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo add context where applicable. While keeping slides simple and concise helps get the point across to viewers, provide additional context if it makes the insight more meaningful. Adding just a bit of contextual information to a slide is particularly helpful if the presentation will be shared digitally, meaning you won't be there to explain the slides verbally.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo say more with less. Omit unnecessary words, decorative elements, and visuals that don't add to your storytelling. Unnecessary elements distract from the information you are trying to provide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo add a personal touch or human element. Including quotes, photos, or videos involving the target users interviewed can make your content not only informative, but also relatable and emotional. By themselves, numbers can feel cold. Personalization can add a sense of warmth and help create a sense of connection between your audience and the insights you're sharing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo apply a consistent visual identity to your slides and pay attention to rhythm, white space, and grid.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about some examples of what not to do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't create a wall of text. The more words you add to a slide, the less likely anyone will read it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't crowd information into your slide with no consideration for white space or visual hierarchy. And while bulleted lists are an excellent way to present key insights, they shouldn't contain complete sentences. Include a few keywords per bulleted item, then supply additional context or explanation verbally.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't present multiple ideas in the same slide. Rather than presenting an insight and a supporting user quote on the same slide, separate them onto two slides so viewers can concentrate on one idea at a time. Can you think of any other ways to improve this slide?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'm looking at the main insight, which reads, \"Before COVID, users enjoyed traveling globally to broaden their horizons connect with diverse groups of people, and immerse themselves in these rich cultures. They are longing to book and enjoy these immersive cultural experiences in their local, domestic, and virtual spaces.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat's a lot of words. Try pausing the video and see if you can communicate the same insight using far less text.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think? Based on what you've learned so far, how would you improve this slide?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any context, we don't know why this travel information is meaningful. In addition, this slide groups several ideas together. Does knowing why survey respondents travel belong on the same slide as information on how far in advance people plan their travel? How about the presentation of the data?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on the audience's needs, perhaps a bar graph would have made this data quicker to grasp. Finally, while the fact that 25 people responded to the survey is good to know, is that as important as the insights being shared? That phrase should be much less visually prominent. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-research-|-what-to-do"},{"id":447945,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 12.2 Presenting Research","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":"must_submit","completed":true,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/lab-graphik.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-heading=\"Overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTo complete this assignment, follow the instructions for üî¨\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLab: 12.2 Presenting Research\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003ein Figma.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/section\u003e","exportId":"g3e791cd47d6e3ba5f4b1df91904958f0"},{"id":447946,"title":"üìö Resources: Presenting Research","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/turn-user-research-smart-design-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTurning User Research Into Smart Design Decisions\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blog.aureliuslab.com/2021/09/27/how-to-present-ux-research-and-turn-insight-to-action/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow to Present UX Research and Turn Insight to Action \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://condens.io/user-research-presentation/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCreating an engaging user research presentation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.uxforthemasses.com/communicate-ux-research/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e8 great ways to communicate UX research insights\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","exportId":"resources-presenting-research"}]},{"id":46330,"name":"12.3 Presenting UX \u0026 Annotating Your Work","status":"completed","unlockDate":null,"prereqs":[46294],"requirement":null,"sequential":false,"exportId":"gecb051c6f4b5d7c0ff7c28dcbc6d3476","items":[{"id":447947,"title":"Annotating UX Deliverables","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy annotate?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lower-fidelity a design deliverable, the greater the need for annotations.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing presenting UX designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery good design presentation needs to tell a clear story. But how do we edit that story so our audience can connect with it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a prompt for discussion. Who attends a UX design presentation? What do they want to know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an article called Defending UX Design Decisions, UX designer and researcher Chris Kiess says, \"if you are going to successfully sell or defend your design, you have to involve those who do not push pixels and make them feel as though they are part of the process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout careful editing, even the most interesting story will fail to hold the attention of your audience. As an example, imagine something really exciting happened during your commute this morning, and you can't wait to tell your coworkers about it. Yet when they ask what happened, you begin with, \"I grabbed my backpack, wallet and keys. Then I made sure the front door was locked. I walked the five blocks to Broadway, stopping at my favorite coffee cart on the way. My bus wasn't due until 8:35, so I read the news for a bit on my phone.\" This may accurately describe your commute, but you can bet your coworkers will have tuned out by the time your story gets to the good part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, the story of your UX design process requires editing before you present it. There's no question the design process is time consuming and you might be tempted to present the whole thing, step-by-step. But will your audience still be listening by the time you reach the part that impacts them? Instead of reciting what you did, focus on why you took certain steps and how those steps were meaningful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if a presentation shouldn't cover every last detail, how should designers shape their story? Here's a five step framework you can use to organize your UX design presentation. Start by introducing the project. Then set context, explain your process, and present your solution. And finally, conclude your presentation and suggest next steps to take. We'll take a closer look at how to use this framework in future videos.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-ux-designs-|-editing-your-story"},{"id":506306,"title":"üé¨ Presenting UX Designs | Introduce the Project","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.3 PRESENTING UX DESIGNS Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837713?h=0dcad5a3bf\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow should we introduce a UX design presentation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBegin by reminding the audience why they're here.

What type of feedback is the audience expected to give?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, summarize the scope of work completed during the project. Who worked on the project and what were their roles? When was the work completed? What was the purpose of the project? Explaining the project's purpose is a good opportunity to remind your audience of the information you were initially given. What was on the project brief? What was known about the target user? Establishing a clear background for your presentation will help your audience understand what to expect and how to evaluate the work being presented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly defining the problem statement is a critical part of any UX design presentation. What problem was the design team trying to solve? Was there a specific pain point facing users? How does this problem impact the business? Plan on referring back frequently to the problem statement. All the work you include in a design presentation should be aimed at finding a solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, before moving forward, make sure to identify any testable assumptions you made while getting started on your project. Design projects often change directions as assumptions are confirmed or disproved by testing.

When presenting UX design work, make sure your audience has a similarly clear understanding of your target user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonas are an important deliverable when setting context in your UX design presentation. Personas reflect your team's understanding of your target audience based on research conducted prior to the launch of the UX design project. Each step of your design process should be presented with your target user's behaviors in mind. Plan on making frequent references to your persona. If your persona is a young front end web developer named Shaima, as seen in this sample persona, then use your presentation to demonstrate how you've solved for Shaima's specific needs and frustrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour target user will inevitably face pain points. What stands between the user and their goal? What impact does each pain point have on the user's journey? How is the business affected if the user can't work past this pain point? While UX design projects often focus on interaction-level pain points, such as a broken or mislabeled interface element causing users to abandon a transaction, some pain points occur at a higher level. Journey-level pain points involve customer dissatisfaction with an overall user journey, while relationship-level pain points describe the souring of a customer's general impression of a brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's not enough to simply name the pain point. Your presentation should also include a detailed description of when the user encounters the frustration. Assuming the pain point occurs at an interaction level, does it happen at a certain moment in the user journey? Is it specific to the user's device? For example, mobile users might be experiencing the pain point while tablet users don't. What about external factors from the user's environment that might impact the experience, such as working in a noisy coffee shop, or using the product in a dark room late at night?Or are there barriers that prevent users with a permanent, situational, or temporary disability from reaching their goal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion. What if your product is not a website or mobile app? Think about a digital user interface in a car's dashboard, for example.

But doing so is not as simple as just describing everything you did, step-by-step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour audience wants to hear what you learned, not what you did. In other words, you're not here to present a complete list of the tasks you accomplished. You're here to present insights gained from performing those tasks in a way that helps stakeholders better understand the needs of target users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully you recognize some variation of this graphic. You should be aware that design is an iterative process that includes empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing. But here's the thing: your UX design presentation audience doesn't really care. You might sometimes refer to the design process to justify a particular experiment. We needed to prototype this specific feature to learn this information about our users. But it's not necessary to provide exhaustive detail on every step of the process‚Äìespecially if a particular step didn't impact the project outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking about what aspects of your design process to include, highlight the parts that accomplish one or more of the following. The task you're presenting might reveal insights about your user, allowing stakeholders to better understand the user's needs and motivations. Or maybe you've uncovered a chance to meet business goals or do something better than the competition. A particular test might've confirmed an earlier assumption, or perhaps it disproved an assumption and forced your team to change directions. Above all, think about each step you include as something intended to inspire confidence in your design solution. If an experiment you ran or a deliverable you created doesn't do any of the above, it's best to leave it out of your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, suppose you conducted an open card sort. When presenting the results, highlight the issues users were having with the existing information architecture that made the card sort necessary. While you might briefly explain how the card sort workshop was executed, you likely wouldn't show a spreadsheet of the workshop results, since spreadsheets are not easy for presentation audiences to understand. Instead focus on the results of the card sort. Do you better understand your user's mental model for how your content is organized? Was a preexisting hypothesis confirmed or invalidated? What should happen next based on the results?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr if you tested a paper prototype, your setup should focus on why low fidelity made sense at this stage, as well as your hypothesis and what you hoped to learn. Then highlight the results of your usability tests, which could include direct quotes or videos. Finally, conclude with takeaways and present the impact the results of the test had on the project direction moving forward. \u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-ux-designs-|-explain-your-process"},{"id":506309,"title":"üé¨ Presenting UX Designs | Present Your Solution","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.3 PRESENTING UX DESIGNS Part 05\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837819?h=810cfa9a7e\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let's take a look at presenting your UX design solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou've already seen this slide labeled \"who is your user\", but that's no accident.

This is your chance to convince stakeholders that your work met project objectives and sought answers to key questions facing the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen presenting a completed prototype, demonstrate screens, features, and interactions that are relevant to the problem you were trying to solve. Prepare your audience by defining the scope of the prototype and stating which user flow your demonstration will concentrate on. That way, the discussion doesn't get derailed and your viewers don't focus on elements you haven't built or are irrelevant to the current conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen presenting your solution, explain how it benefits your target persona. You designed for a specific user facing specific obstacles in a specific context. Was your solution helpful? Are target users now better equipped to overcome pain points? Citing evidence is an effective way to show, rather than tell, the impact of your solution. You might include data highlighting the effectiveness of your new design versus the old design, as well as quotes from users or videos from usability tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your audience consists of stakeholders, they'll be anxious to know how your solution increases revenue or otherwise meets business needs.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing presenting UI designs. Let's begin by discussing how to plan your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUI designer Tess Gadd says don't present your work like a painting, present it like a building. After all, good architects don't make arbitrary choices. When presenting the designs for a building, they'll start from the blueprints and focus on practical considerations like what materials the building is made from, where the morning and afternoon sun will hit, or how many people can fit on each floor before it becomes a fire hazard. You'll want to approach presenting UI the same way, by focusing on the impact each design choice will have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you're planning your presentation, make sure you know who's in your audience. When presenting to stakeholders‚Äìin other words, anyone who has an interest in your project and influence over your decision-making‚Äìyou'll need to speak the language of business. Stakeholders might not know much about the design process, so it's your responsibility to connect your explanation of that process to their product division and business goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're instead presenting to teammates, keep their strengths and interests in mind. Developers, for example, will be interested in the technological feasibility, performance, and accessibility of your solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any design presentation, your UI design presentation should tell a cohesive story, one that begins with the problem you were solving for and ends with the benefits your designs have for both users and the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion. What if your audience contains both stakeholders and teammates? What strategies could help your presentation meet the needs of both groups? \u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-ui-designs-|-plan-your-presentation"},{"id":506312,"title":"üé¨ Presenting UI Designs | Prepare Your Slides","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.4 PRESENTING UI DESIGNS Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837902?h=5713373094\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let's discuss preparing your UI design presentation slides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, you'll need to select the design deliverables that add meaning to your story. Keep in mind that just because you completed a deliverable doesn't mean it automatically belongs in your presentation. With each deliverable, ask yourself, will my audience understand why this deliverable is relevant to the problem I'm trying to solve? Did this help me test the effectiveness of my solution with target users? Is this moving my story towards a meaningful conclusion? If not, leave it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you've decided what imagery to include, think about how to best present it. In the image on screen, we see a closeup of a dropdown navigation being interacted with, illustrating that it's not always necessary to include a screenshot of the entire layout. Especially when your work focuses on one small part of the interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen demonstrating a specific improvement to a user interface, it often helps to show the old and improved version side-by-side. While the designer of the mobile interface on screen has separated the most critical link visually to indicate its importance, without comparing this change to the previous design, the impact of the improvement might be hard to grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use this technique of comparing old and improved versions to demonstrate accessibility improvements to your interface as well. For example, interface elements that are too small or too close together can cause issues for users with motor skills disabilities. The image on screen visualizes the benefits of adjusting an interface to meet the WCAG target size recommendation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareless slide design can make even the most polished UI designs look underwhelming or ineffective. The principles of visual hierarchy, white space, grid, and type hierarchy matter just as much when designing slides as they do when creating a user interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA consistent layout from slide to slide reduces cognitive load for viewers and keeps attention focused on the most important content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can additionally reduce cognitive load by sticking to one idea per slide. Include just enough words, imagery, and data on each slide to get a single, memorable point across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe cautious about over-designing your slides. If viewers are paying more attention to the design of your slide than the actual content, that's a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, respect the client's style guide while designing your slides. Keep the color, type, spacing, and iconography you apply to each slide consistent with the existing style guide or design system. If your client doesn't have one, create your own rough style guide and stick to it. \u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-ui-designs-|-prepare-your-slides"},{"id":506313,"title":"üé¨ Presenting UI Designs | Describing Your Design","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.4 PRESENTING UI DESIGNS Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837938?h=55cd6233b5\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce your presentation slides are ready, how do you describe your design choices to an audience? Let's take a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his 2015 textbook Articulating Design Decisions, product designer and author Tom Greever says that one of the best ways to make a case for your designs is to directly connect it to the needs of the business. Which is a reminder that you didn't make your UI design decisions arbitrarily, but instead to enhance usability and increase the chances of a successful interaction with your client's product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUI designers don't make subjective choices. It's not a question of which color looks better or which typefaces pair the nicest. You've made objective decisions meant to satisfy specific criteria. And that objective reasoning is what you need to convey when presenting your designs. There are four key reasons a design decision might be made: to meet a business need, to help users reach a goal, to apply research findings, or because of a limitation or requirement impacting the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders are anxious to hear how your solution meets business needs. In the example on screen, making the price of the package being offered bold, visually prominent, and above the fold increased the number of signups and inquiries received by the business. If changes such as making an interface element more prominent, increasing white space, or improving wording are designed to bring more conversions, highlight this reasoning during your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall attention to interface design solutions that have been guided by your client's existing design system or style guide, or are consistent with the brand's established identity. What if your client doesn't have an existing design system, style guide, or brand identity? That's a tough situation for a UI designer. When presenting your designs, emphasize the need for consistency from screen to screen in terms of color, typography, spacing, motion, voice and tone, and interface element design. By creating and applying a consistent visual language, you can help your client begin to establish their brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way to justify UI design decisions is to describe how your solution benefits the user. Does your design help users figure out where they are, how to get around, and what navigation options they currently have? Does it inspire users to take action or move them closer towards a goal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes business needs align with user goals. When your UI improvements relieve user pain points within a checkout flow, the user has a successful experience and business profits increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHighlight any consideration your UI design gives for the user's context. In the image on screen, we see a smartwatch app intended to be used while jogging. Think about what a user might need before, during, and after their run. What features matter most to the user? What might contribute to a successful run? What factors might make the app difficult to use? Might the screen be difficult to see in bright sunlight, or while jogging after dark? Should any features be muted so they don't distract or annoy the user during their run?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes your solution make use of a familiar design pattern? Implementing common design patterns reduces cognitive load for the user and makes your interface feel familiar. Depending on the popularity of the pattern, your stakeholders might not be familiar with it, so be prepared to list its benefits and provide relevant examples while explaining your process for choosing the pattern. What rules guidance implementation? How did you know it was the right choice for your stakeholder's product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're applying data-driven decisions to your interface design, make that clear during your presentation. Your decision might be motivated by primary research you conducted yourself, such as analytics suggesting users commonly bail out at a specific point in a flow. Or you might use secondary research gathered by people outside your organization, such as online articles written by subject matter experts. You might also understand your target audience's preferences thanks to usability testing conducted by your team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen describing or defending your design choices, you might also remind your audience of time, budget, and technology constraints. The sky, isn't always the limit when creating an interface. Sometimes a proposed solution can't be achieved within the project's timeline or budget, or it might be difficult for the development team to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes proposed designs need to be adjusted to work with established web development standards, such as semantic HTML. Other changes might be motivated by reviewing WCAG accessibility requirements or by running usability tests with disabled users. Your presentation should highlight any design solution that enables your stakeholder's product to comply with existing standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion. Does a designer's personal preference matter in a UI design presentation? Or is it all about user goals and business needs? \u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-ui-designs-|-describing-your-design"},{"id":506314,"title":"üé¨ Presenting UI Designs | Shaping and Receiving Feedback","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":null,"completed":false,"content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.4 PRESENTING UI DESIGNS Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837984?h=811c29b89f\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, let's discuss shaping and receiving feedback from your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresenting UI design can be a unique challenge because audiences often give subjective feedback. When the focus is on whether a participant likes or dislikes certain color or type face choices, or the size or placement of interface elements, a meeting can quickly get derailed. How can we shift the discussion away from personal preferences and towards the objective impact each design decision has?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most effective methods of receiving objective feedback is to schedule regular feedback sessions with relevant stakeholders at each step of the design process. If you only present completed designs your audience hasn't encountered before, they might not understand what motivated your design decisions. Instead, let stakeholders witness why and how your designs evolve over time. This also allows them the opportunity to provide feedback early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the beginning of your presentation, while reminding your audience of the project goal and the problem you were trying to solve, set clear expectations on the type of feedback you're hoping to receive. Maybe you're looking to hear about the success of the overall flow, or about specific interactions, or subtle changes to microcopy. Alert your audience to your feedback needs early so they know what to look for while listening to your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen designing your slides, you'll want to apply a consistent grid, allow for generous white space, and use principles of visual hierarchy to direct attention to the most important elements. While we've made this point already, it's worth repeating, as clean, professional slide design boosts your audience's confidence in you and keeps them from getting distracted. Researchers call this the Aesthetic Usability Effect. Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's an important rule. Keep Lorem Ipsum out of your presentations. You shouldn't be designing with Lorem Ipsum in the first place, since your decision should support actual content rather than placeholder text. In a design presentation, Lorem Ipsum gives slides an amateur feel. Your stakeholders might also start wondering about all that Latin text, rather than concentrating on your interface design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, be sure to conclude your presentation memorably. Ending by saying, \"so, what do you think?\" is not all that effective. Your final slides should refer back to the original problem you were trying to solve, provide recommended next steps, and summarize lessons learned during the project. In addition, your conclusion is a good chance to remind your audience of the feedback you're seeking. Try asking your audience a specific question related to your project goals, such as \"do you think this improved flow will lead to more signups?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn product designer Finna Wang's portfolio, she concludes her case study for her design work on the Jambb social media platform with lessons learned from the project, a recommendation for an additional feature, and a business opportunity for the Jambb application to integrate videos from additional social media services. In addition to asking stakeholders to evaluate the success of the design project, Wang could also spark additional discussion from her audience with these three thoughtful topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let's talk about receiving feedback from your audience. In the words of UI and UX designer Jeremiah Lam, scheduling regular feedback sessions helps cultivate a culture where feedback and opinions are respected and seen as part of the design process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen receiving feedback, resist the urge to interrupt and defend your designs. Take notes and hear the participant out fully. Before you respond, ask clarifying questions about the feedback you receive. Keep your questions goal oriented. For example, if a stakeholder suggests a color, typography, or spacing change on a landing page, you might ask how the change would draw more attention to the Call To Action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen listening to feedback, consider where the participant is coming from. Stakeholders will naturally be most concerned with whether your designs meet business objectives. Designers, on the other hand, will offer critiques to help strengthen your designs. Developers will comment on the feasibility and any possible implementation issues. And project managers might ask how the solution fits within the project‚Äôs requirements and scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you need to defend a design decision, cite evidence that supports your point of view. This might include a guiding design principle, a reference to the client's design system or style guide, or data from research or usability testing. Sometimes you'll need additional time to evaluate feedback. While many critiques are valuable, some will be irrelevant to the project goals or unrealistic to implement. Rather than responding on the spot, it's okay to ask for time to think things over. Your audience will be glad to hear their feedback is being considered. And you can use the extra time to work out whether to implement the change or tactfully push back against it. \u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"presenting-ui-designs-|-shaping-and-receiving-feedback"},{"id":447952,"title":"üî¨ Lab: 12.4 Presenting UI","type":"Assignment","indent":0,"locked":false,"submissionTypes":"a website url or a file upload","graded":true,"pointsPossible":1.0,"dueAt":null,"lockAt":null,"unlockAt":null,"requirement":"must_submit","completed":true,"content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem;

Let's take a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his 2015 textbook Articulating Design Decisions, product designer and author Tom Greever says that one of the best ways to make a case for your designs is to directly connect it to the needs of the business. Which is a reminder that you didn't make your UI design decisions arbitrarily, but instead to enhance usability and increase the chances of a successful interaction with your client's product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUI designers don't make subjective choices. It's not a question of which color looks better or which typefaces pair the nicest. You've made objective decisions meant to satisfy specific criteria. And that objective reasoning is what you need to convey when presenting your designs. There are four key reasons a design decision might be made: to meet a business need, to help users reach a goal, to apply research findings, or because of a limitation or requirement impacting the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders are anxious to hear how your solution meets business needs. In the example on screen, making the price of the package being offered bold, visually prominent, and above the fold increased the number of signups and inquiries received by the business. If changes such as making an interface element more prominent, increasing white space, or improving wording are designed to bring more conversions, highlight this reasoning during your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall attention to interface design solutions that have been guided by your client's existing design system or style guide, or are consistent with the brand's established identity. What if your client doesn't have an existing design system, style guide, or brand identity? That's a tough situation for a UI designer. When presenting your designs, emphasize the need for consistency from screen to screen in terms of color, typography, spacing, motion, voice and tone, and interface element design. By creating and applying a consistent visual language, you can help your client begin to establish their brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother way to justify UI design decisions is to describe how your solution benefits the user. Does your design help users figure out where they are, how to get around, and what navigation options they currently have? Does it inspire users to take action or move them closer towards a goal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes business needs align with user goals. When your UI improvements relieve user pain points within a checkout flow, the user has a successful experience and business profits increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHighlight any consideration your UI design gives for the user's context. In the image on screen, we see a smartwatch app intended to be used while jogging. Think about what a user might need before, during, and after their run. What features matter most to the user? What might contribute to a successful run? What factors might make the app difficult to use? Might the screen be difficult to see in bright sunlight, or while jogging after dark? Should any features be muted so they don't distract or annoy the user during their run?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes your solution make use of a familiar design pattern? Implementing common design patterns reduces cognitive load for the user and makes your interface feel familiar. Depending on the popularity of the pattern, your stakeholders might not be familiar with it, so be prepared to list its benefits and provide relevant examples while explaining your process for choosing the pattern. What rules guidance implementation? How did you know it was the right choice for your stakeholder's product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're applying data-driven decisions to your interface design, make that clear during your presentation. Your decision might be motivated by primary research you conducted yourself, such as analytics suggesting users commonly bail out at a specific point in a flow. Or you might use secondary research gathered by people outside your organization, such as online articles written by subject matter experts. You might also understand your target audience's preferences thanks to usability testing conducted by your team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen describing or defending your design choices, you might also remind your audience of time, budget, and technology constraints. The sky, isn't always the limit when creating an interface. Sometimes a proposed solution can't be achieved within the project's timeline or budget, or it might be difficult for the development team to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes proposed designs need to be adjusted to work with established web development standards, such as semantic HTML. Other changes might be motivated by reviewing WCAG accessibility requirements or by running usability tests with disabled users. Your presentation should highlight any design solution that enables your stakeholder's product to comply with existing standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion. Does a designer's personal preference matter in a UI design presentation? Or is it all about user goals and business needs? \u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"information-design-|-what-is-information-design","title":" üé¨ Information Design | What is Information Design?","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.1 INFORMATION DESIGN Part 01\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765855000?h=b88465edcd\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello, my name is Anwar and I'm part of the Product Design curriculum team here at Flatiron School. In this series of lectures we'll be discussing information design. So how do we define information design? To quote author and information designer Joel Katz, our job as information designers is to clarify, to simplify, and to make information accessible to the people who will need it and use it to make important decisions. Information needs to be in a form they can understand and use meaningfully, and to tell the truth of what things mean and how they work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, information design is concerned with making complex information easier to understand and use. It emerged as a response to people's need to understand and use technical information as well as computer interfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation design combines the unique disciplines of typography, graphic design, linguistics, psychology, ergonomics, and computing. When users are faced with a complex task, your job as a designer is to make it as clear and simple as possible. While this can be achieved in a variety of ways, it's critical above all to understand the user's mental model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat factors shape the way users understand the information in front of them? You can also assist users by using plain, understandable language, by carefully labeling interface elements, and by reducing visual chaos by using grids On the screen in front of us, we see a Venn diagram visualizing the overlapping components of information design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuccessful information design is found at the intersection of data, visual graphics, and narrative storytelling.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"data-visualization-|-accessible-visualizations","title":"üé¨ Data Visualization | Accessible Visualizations","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Data Visualization | Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765864002?h=e9cab40e17\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo data visualizations have their own considerations when it comes to creating an accessible experience? Let's find out. As much as possible, use plain language when labeling your charts. When using industry-specific terminology, make sure that the terms you use are essential to understanding the data and appropriate for your audience's level of knowledge.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake sure the labels you create for your chart are clear, easy to read, and do an obvious job of labeling data points. Here we see a clearly labeled chart illustrating the effectiveness of Calls To Action within an email campaign in a particular week.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe X axis is labeled based on the date, while the Y axis is labeled based on how many thousands of clicks each Call To Action received. The chart also has a legend indicating the blue line on the graph represents new accounts opened, and the green line represents unsubscriptions. So that's effective labeling.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet I see a potential accessibility issue still lingering. Can you spot it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's an award-winning visualization called The Daily Routines of Famous Creative People. The labeling looks clear enough. We see the 24 hours of the day, as well as the sleep and creative work habits of a number of authors, musicians, and artists.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, I still believe there's an accessibility issue. Can you find it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you mentioned color, great job. When applying color to data visualizations designers need to follow two rules. Don't rely on color alone to provide meaning. And do use sufficient color contrast. Each of the previous two charts relied solely on color to convey information.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnscreen we see two charts as viewed using colorblindness simulators. In the top chart, labeling the bars of the graph directly helps audiences who can't distinguish between the colors of the bars. In the pie chart at the bottom, a thin white separator aids viewers who can't distinguish between the low contrast colors used to color slices of the pie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if users can't see your chart? Partner with developers to write an effective alt description that at the very least lists the type of the chart, describes the story being told by the data, and explains the reason for including the chart. Linking users to the original data source has two benefits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes your chart feel more trustworthy, and it provides an additional resource for audiences who can't see your chart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a chart from the New York Times from 2015 labeled gun murders per 100,000 people.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing storytelling and presenting. Let's start with storytelling 101. Fantasy novelist Brandon Sanderson says that the purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Which is an interesting way to look at storytelling,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut how can we apply that idea to design presentations? Let's start with a discussion prompt. How do you define an effective story?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we need to recognize that design presentations are meant to be customized based on your understanding of your audience. Who is your audience? Are they stakeholders? Designers? Engineers? Or a mixture? What is important to them? What knowledge level do they bring to your presentation? When presentations fall flat, it's because the presenter didn't compel the audience to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdd drama by approaching your presentation as a narrative. Make the problem you were trying to solve immediately clear. Highlight the challenges you overcame, and reach a memorable conclusion. When building your presentation as a story, emphasize conflict. What pain points faced the user? What challenges stood in your way as you attempted to define the problem, alleviate pain points, or test a solution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a sense of continuity in your narrative using foreshadowing and echoing techniques. Foreshadowing gives an indication or hint of something important happening later in the story, while echoing means referring back to a lesson learned earlier. Transitions link one piece of the story to the next and keep the audience eager to learn what's coming on the next set of slides. Think of your favorite action or suspense novel. Each chapter ends with an unanswered question, making it hard for the reader to put the book down until they've discovered the answer. \"Show, don't tell\" is common storytelling advice. Instead of explaining what happened, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, visuals, and appeals to the reader's emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep the number of words per slide to a minimum, and instead choose the graphics, charts, user quotes, and verbal anecdotes that will tell the same story, but more vividly. Common storytelling techniques include the hero's journey or monomyth in which an adventurer goes on a journey, overcomes a crisis, and returns home changed or transformed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one reason why many design presentations end with what the designer would do differently next time based on what they learned from this project. The converging ideas method shows the audience how different approaches or ways of thinking ultimately merge to form one single, stronger idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA false start story is when you begin to tell a seemingly predictable story before unexpectedly disrupting it and beginning all over again. This might happen when an insight uncovered during research or user testing led to a total change in project direction. In medias res is a technique for beginning a narrative in the heat of the action before returning to the beginning and explaining how you got there. Used appropriately, this can hook your audience from the beginning. Just be careful not to reveal too much of the project's conclusion too early.

Instead, teams make assumptions based on what they currently know about their audience. Using that assumption, teams form a hypothesis about how a particular solution might impact user and business outcomes\u0026nbsp;and create a testable design iteration. That testable design iteration is known as a minimum viable product or MVP. We'll take a closer look at MVPs before long.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLean UX methods encourage continuous discovery.

If the user doesn't want to change their behavior, we shouldn't manipulate them into changing or developing new habits against their will. If the user does want to change their behavior, however, the CREATE framework demonstrates that a lot can dissuade them from actually taking action. How can we remove obstacles that might prevent a user from making better decisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo design for behavior change, it's not enough to understand how the mind makes decisions. We need a process that helps us intervene when users are struggling to make the right decision. The DECIDE process is an acronym for a 6-step process that helps us decide what sort of intervention is appropriate for a specific user facing a specific situation. First we define the problem. Then we explore the context in which the problem occurs. Next we craft an intervention, implement the intervention within the product, and determine the impact. Finally, we evaluate the results and determine next steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to our example of a user who wishes to become more active by taking more steps per day, how might a fitness apps such as Fitbit use the DECIDE process to influence decision-making? Can a digital product help encourage users to choose the stairs instead of the elevator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen defining the problem, we start by identifying the audience and understanding what they want to achieve. People who want to get more active or take more steps per day are a rather broad audience. We might narrow that down to urban office workers who want more activity during their workday, since these are workers who often face the choice of using an elevator or the stairs. We should also define what success looks like. Is an average increase of three flights of stairs per day achievable? How long should it take for users to form this new habit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat stands in the way of users achieving their goals? While exploring the context, we gather data about the obstacles preventing users from changing their behavior. We can learn about user attitudes by surveying and interviewing them, and use contextual inquiry to observe their behavior. If we're a fitness application trying to encourage more physical activity during the workday,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe might also want to gather information about the relationship between office workers and their phones and smart watches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you gather data, you'll start to form groups of users based on their previous experiences. Some users will have tried fitness apps before and some won't. Some users will have negative associations with climbing stairs and some won't. These groupings are important because it's unlikely one solution will satisfy every type of persona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen crafting an intervention, choose a persona from your context-gathering stage, and come up with a hypothesis for intervening in that user's decision-making process. Then prototype an interface you can use to test that hypothesis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking of how to encourage users to take the stairs, our first instinct might be to cue the user with a well-timed push notification. However behavioral design tactics to motivate users should consider all six stages of the CREATE framework. Let's look at timing, for example. How can we motivate users to take the stairs now, rather than putting it off until later? One possibility might be notifying the user they're closing in on a goal. A user who realizes they're nearing 7,900 steps for the day might take the stairs to reach 8,000. What about ability and experience? How can we convince users who have struggled to build exercise habits that they're capable this time? \"Fresh start\" messaging can help ‚Äì that is, messaging that makes this journey feel special and past attempts feel irrelevant. In addition, some products use social proof: the idea that if your friends can meet behavior change goals, so can you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you've settled on an intervention, it's time to prototype and test. In addition to testing the effectiveness of the intervention, you'll want to assess the ethics of the solution. An ethical product is transparent about its purpose, doesn't harm users or cause them to grow addicted, and ensures all user actions are voluntary. That last reminder is a critical one. Behavioral design is ethical only when users want to change their behavior and can make informed decisions to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo test the impact of your intervention, make sure you're only conducting one experiment at a time. Then run an A/B test. Divide users at random into a control group, who see the old version of your product, versus a test group who experiences the new prototype. As with any test, make sure you've clearly defined what you're hoping to learn. You'll want a clear hypothesis stating the outcome your team is expecting to happen as well as metrics for defining success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any design process, the DECIDE process is an iterative one. If your intervention was successful, you might implement it as is, or continue to refine it to maximize its impact. On the other hand, many behavioral design interventions aren't successful. Making beneficial decisions is hard for users, and nudging users towards positive habits is hard for product designers. Be prepared to back up to previous stages in the DECIDE process frequently and run numerous experiments before settling on the right approach.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"introducing-dashboards","title":"Introducing Dashboards","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eDashboards show relevant information\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThink about the role the dashboard serves in a car.

In the year 2000, an upscale California food market increased its sales of gourmet jam by 27% by simply reducing the number of available flavors from 24 to 6. Too many choices overwhelm people, a phenomenon sometimes called analysis paralysis. As an example, think of the last time you struggled to find anything to watch on Netflix, despite having thousands of movies and shows to choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurated options especially help when people make decisions with health or financial consequences that can be stressful for users. Roobrik, a web app helping users consider assisted living options for loved ones needing care, helps limit analysis paralysis by only providing a few good options. After gathering information from the user about the loved one's needs and health, the app provides a few recommended options along with a clear rationale for why those choices might be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile your product might provide the option of an expert level experience for advanced users, everyday users don't want to be faced with a ton of detail when making decisions. Present high level categories and the most critical details first, then allow users to explore additional details on a separate screen or by uncollapsing a panel. The Weight Watchers app pictured here frees users from counting calories by bundling nutritional information into one metric, a daily point system. When entering meals, users are initially faced with only a few simple, instantly recognizable categories: veggies, water, breakfast, lunch, dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople don't always understand the consequences of a decision. By making the potential downside to a decision transparent, you'll inspire trust in your product and help users make more confident choices. While the Mint budgeting app recommends a method of debt reduction called the debt snowball, the approach is ineffective for users with high-interest debt. If the app didn't make this drawback obvious, users could easily select the wrong strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding user tendencies and biases can help designers nudge users towards a positive decision. For example, the anchoring bias means that people often estimate value by focusing on a single, initial piece of information. Designers can take advantage of this bias by implementing well-chosen default values. In 2015, the British nonprofit organization Oxfam saw a 23% increase in donations simply by adding a ¬£4 suggested default before its Donate Now call to action. This change reduces the decision burden on users. Instead of worrying what a reasonable donation might look like, they can accept or adjust the recommended value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunk cost fallacy means that people often continue investing in an activity because of past time, effort, or money sunk into the activity, even when the reward is no longer available. This is the tendency that keeps us waiting for a bus that's 20 minutes late rather than searching for alternate transportation. When apps such as Duolingo reward user streaks, in addition to providing a positive feeling, it reminds the user they don't want to waste their accumulated time investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing presenting research. Let's start by examining why presenting the results from your research is valuable. UX researcher Nikki Anderson says it doesn't matter how good the findings are if you aren't able to communicate them effectively with your team. From learning about data visualization, you might recall that data‚Äìin other words, raw, unorganized facts and numbers‚Äìis useless until you provide it with context, organization, and a purpose.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same is true when presenting to team members and stakeholders. Until you convert your research findings into actionable information, your raw data lacks value.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you provide raw data, when your presentation is too lengthy or too disorganized, or when your findings aren't obvious and actionable, your research gets ignored.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what does an actionable research presentation consist of? First of all, reminding stakeholders of why the research was conducted gives context to your data. What were you hoping to find? What value does this research project provide to the business?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore starting a research project, you should have a clear hypothesis or testable assumption in mind about what you're expecting to happen. When presenting the results of your research, remind your audience about the assumptions made about target users. Did your research project confirm or contradict these assumptions?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour research presentation should include a brief description of the methods used to collect your data. How many users did you interview or observe? What were the pros and cons of each method? Keep this portion of your presentation concise and appropriate to your audience. Stakeholders don't need to hear every last detail of your research methodology,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust enough to get a sense of the thoroughness and effectiveness of your approach.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost importantly, never present all the data you've gathered, as this wastes the audience's time and your energy. \u0026nbsp;Instead, highlight the findings that will matter most to your audience and inspire meaningful action.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen highlighting key insights from your research data, apply the same principles as you would to any data visualization.

If users didn't need that product or feature those months were wasted.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf designers work to thoroughly complete a high resolution prototype before handing it off to developers, it means developers lack opportunities to provide feedback during the design process. The waterfall method also sometimes leaves teams sitting idle, waiting for the previous deliverable to receive sign-off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2001, a group of developers released the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, calling for developers to move away from working towards a single massive product launch in favor of short sprints with modest short-term goals. Working in short sprints, followed by testing, allows developers to make adjustments when something isn't working.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy 2013 designers realized they needed a new method of working to keep pace with developers and encourage more frequent communication between teams and with target users.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat inefficiencies with the waterfall method make it incompatible with Agile development methods?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat opportunities do you see to improve the waterfall design method?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"lean-ux-a-history","title":"Lean UX: A History","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eUnderstanding the need for Lean UX\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eTo understand why the Lean UX framework is needed, it‚Äôs helpful to understand the history of UX design prior to Lean working methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\"\u003eWaterfall UX\u003c/h3\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003ePrior to 2013, UX teams tended to rely upon the waterfall method, in which one stage of the design process is completed and signed off upon before the next stage can begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cfigure style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/waterfall-method.png\" alt=\"Waterfall method in stages: requirements, design, implementation, verification, maintenance\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5718/files/3268593\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"\u003e\n        \u003cfigcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\"\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://uxplanet.org/the-evolution-of-ux-process-methodology-47f52557178b\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Evolution of UX Process Methodology\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe steps of the waterfall method might look something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003col\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eConduct discovery research\u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eCreate deliverables aimed at understanding user motivations (personas, task flows, journey maps)\u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eUse ideation techniques to generate ideas\u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eCreate medium-fidelity wireframes\u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eTransform the wireframe into a mockup by adding high-fidelity details\u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eDevelop the high-fidelity design into a working product\u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eLaunch the product\u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"\u003eGather user feedback on the live product, and repeat the process\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ol\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eEach deliverable in the waterfall method is handed off to another team when completed, which is part of the problem.

Do call out key quantitative data and emphasize its correlation with qualitative data.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo add context where applicable. While keeping slides simple and concise helps get the point across to viewers, provide additional context if it makes the insight more meaningful. Adding just a bit of contextual information to a slide is particularly helpful if the presentation will be shared digitally, meaning you won't be there to explain the slides verbally.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo say more with less. Omit unnecessary words, decorative elements, and visuals that don't add to your storytelling. Unnecessary elements distract from the information you are trying to provide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo add a personal touch or human element. Including quotes, photos, or videos involving the target users interviewed can make your content not only informative, but also relatable and emotional. By themselves, numbers can feel cold. Personalization can add a sense of warmth and help create a sense of connection between your audience and the insights you're sharing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo apply a consistent visual identity to your slides and pay attention to rhythm, white space, and grid.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about some examples of what not to do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't create a wall of text. The more words you add to a slide, the less likely anyone will read it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't crowd information into your slide with no consideration for white space or visual hierarchy. And while bulleted lists are an excellent way to present key insights, they shouldn't contain complete sentences. Include a few keywords per bulleted item, then supply additional context or explanation verbally.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't present multiple ideas in the same slide. Rather than presenting an insight and a supporting user quote on the same slide, separate them onto two slides so viewers can concentrate on one idea at a time. Can you think of any other ways to improve this slide?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'm looking at the main insight, which reads, \"Before COVID, users enjoyed traveling globally to broaden their horizons connect with diverse groups of people, and immerse themselves in these rich cultures. They are longing to book and enjoy these immersive cultural experiences in their local, domestic, and virtual spaces.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat's a lot of words. Try pausing the video and see if you can communicate the same insight using far less text.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think? Based on what you've learned so far, how would you improve this slide?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any context, we don't know why this travel information is meaningful. In addition, this slide groups several ideas together. Does knowing why survey respondents travel belong on the same slide as information on how far in advance people plan their travel? How about the presentation of the data?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on the audience's needs, perhaps a bar graph would have made this data quicker to grasp. Finally, while the fact that 25 people responded to the survey is good to know, is that as important as the insights being shared? That phrase should be much less visually prominent. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"presenting-ui-designs-|-shaping-and-receiving-feedback","title":"üé¨ Presenting UI Designs | Shaping and Receiving Feedback","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.4 PRESENTING UI DESIGNS Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837984?h=811c29b89f\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, let's discuss shaping and receiving feedback from your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresenting UI design can be a unique challenge because audiences often give subjective feedback. When the focus is on whether a participant likes or dislikes certain color or type face choices, or the size or placement of interface elements, a meeting can quickly get derailed. How can we shift the discussion away from personal preferences and towards the objective impact each design decision has?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most effective methods of receiving objective feedback is to schedule regular feedback sessions with relevant stakeholders at each step of the design process. If you only present completed designs your audience hasn't encountered before, they might not understand what motivated your design decisions. Instead, let stakeholders witness why and how your designs evolve over time. This also allows them the opportunity to provide feedback early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the beginning of your presentation, while reminding your audience of the project goal and the problem you were trying to solve, set clear expectations on the type of feedback you're hoping to receive. Maybe you're looking to hear about the success of the overall flow, or about specific interactions, or subtle changes to microcopy. Alert your audience to your feedback needs early so they know what to look for while listening to your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen designing your slides, you'll want to apply a consistent grid, allow for generous white space, and use principles of visual hierarchy to direct attention to the most important elements. While we've made this point already, it's worth repeating, as clean, professional slide design boosts your audience's confidence in you and keeps them from getting distracted. Researchers call this the Aesthetic Usability Effect. Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's an important rule. Keep Lorem Ipsum out of your presentations. You shouldn't be designing with Lorem Ipsum in the first place, since your decision should support actual content rather than placeholder text. In a design presentation, Lorem Ipsum gives slides an amateur feel. Your stakeholders might also start wondering about all that Latin text, rather than concentrating on your interface design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, be sure to conclude your presentation memorably. Ending by saying, \"so, what do you think?\" is not all that effective. Your final slides should refer back to the original problem you were trying to solve, provide recommended next steps, and summarize lessons learned during the project. In addition, your conclusion is a good chance to remind your audience of the feedback you're seeking. Try asking your audience a specific question related to your project goals, such as \"do you think this improved flow will lead to more signups?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn product designer Finna Wang's portfolio, she concludes her case study for her design work on the Jambb social media platform with lessons learned from the project, a recommendation for an additional feature, and a business opportunity for the Jambb application to integrate videos from additional social media services. In addition to asking stakeholders to evaluate the success of the design project, Wang could also spark additional discussion from her audience with these three thoughtful topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let's talk about receiving feedback from your audience. In the words of UI and UX designer Jeremiah Lam, scheduling regular feedback sessions helps cultivate a culture where feedback and opinions are respected and seen as part of the design process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen receiving feedback, resist the urge to interrupt and defend your designs. Take notes and hear the participant out fully. Before you respond, ask clarifying questions about the feedback you receive. Keep your questions goal oriented. For example, if a stakeholder suggests a color, typography, or spacing change on a landing page, you might ask how the change would draw more attention to the Call To Action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen listening to feedback, consider where the participant is coming from. Stakeholders will naturally be most concerned with whether your designs meet business objectives. Designers, on the other hand, will offer critiques to help strengthen your designs. Developers will comment on the feasibility and any possible implementation issues. And project managers might ask how the solution fits within the project‚Äôs requirements and scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you need to defend a design decision, cite evidence that supports your point of view. This might include a guiding design principle, a reference to the client's design system or style guide, or data from research or usability testing. Sometimes you'll need additional time to evaluate feedback. While many critiques are valuable, some will be irrelevant to the project goals or unrealistic to implement. Rather than responding on the spot, it's okay to ask for time to think things over. Your audience will be glad to hear their feedback is being considered. And you can use the extra time to work out whether to implement the change or tactfully push back against it. \u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"data-visualization-|-information-design-vs-data-visualization","title":"üé¨ Data Visualization | Information Design vs. Data Visualization","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Data Visualization | Part 01\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765864082?h=f7ddee9211\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello, my name is Anwar and I'm part of the Product Design curriculum team here at Flatiron School. In this series of lectures, we'll be discussing data visualization. Data visualization sounds pretty similar to information design, but are they the same? Let's take a look.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital and content marketer Erin McCoy defines data visualization as the translation of datasets into a meaningful and easy to understand visual medium.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Venn diagram on screen demonstrates how data analysis, data visualization, and information design overlap. So while data visualization involves some of the same skills as information design, it also requires being able to analyze data to find meaning.

They're end goals expressed from a user's perspective. What value does your current solution offer the user?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUser Stories keep teams focused on solving real problems faced by users and keep the whole team moving towards a common goal.

And breaking a project into short sprints with modest goals provides many small victories and drives momentum.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking about how to format User Stories, start with a persona. In other words, you should have a solid idea of who you're building this product for. The task or action describes what the user is trying to achieve. The description should avoid mentioning the user interface or any specific features someone might use when performing the action.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe objective or purpose explains the larger problem that needs solving.

What do customers need when performing a job, and how will you gauge how successful they are at having those needs met? You can measure needs and success rates by using Desired Outcome Statements, which consists of four parts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe direction of change starts with a verb showing what the customer hopes to change. The unit of measure, specifies what the customer wants to increase or decrease. The object of the need is the thing being measured or controlled, while the clarifier provides contextual clues to clarify circumstances.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose your customer wants to attend a conference related to their industry. They're hoping to learn valuable information, share some of that information with coworkers, and network with conference attendees. How can we use Desired Outcome Statements to create measurable success criteria related to their trip to the conference?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we see four examples. Our first Desired Outcome Statement, \"increase the likelihood of getting permission from a boss to attend\", can be divided into four parts. Increase is a measurable direction of change. If a customer was previously only 50% successful, we can try to improve that number. The likelihood is a measurable rate of success.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customer's need is represented by the third part of the outcome statement. They need to get permission. Our outcome statement ends with a clarification. When does the customer need permission? When asking a boss to attend the conference. Our final three Desired Outcome Statements‚Äì maximize the ability to remember relevant content from conference presentations,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eminimize the time it takes to summarize conference insights for sharing with colleagues, and maximize the likelihood of networking with thought leaders in the field‚Äì all follow the same format.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow you give it a try.

When presenting UX design work, make sure your audience has a similarly clear understanding of your target user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonas are an important deliverable when setting context in your UX design presentation. Personas reflect your team's understanding of your target audience based on research conducted prior to the launch of the UX design project. Each step of your design process should be presented with your target user's behaviors in mind. Plan on making frequent references to your persona. If your persona is a young front end web developer named Shaima, as seen in this sample persona, then use your presentation to demonstrate how you've solved for Shaima's specific needs and frustrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour target user will inevitably face pain points. What stands between the user and their goal? What impact does each pain point have on the user's journey? How is the business affected if the user can't work past this pain point? While UX design projects often focus on interaction-level pain points, such as a broken or mislabeled interface element causing users to abandon a transaction, some pain points occur at a higher level. Journey-level pain points involve customer dissatisfaction with an overall user journey, while relationship-level pain points describe the souring of a customer's general impression of a brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's not enough to simply name the pain point. Your presentation should also include a detailed description of when the user encounters the frustration. Assuming the pain point occurs at an interaction level, does it happen at a certain moment in the user journey? Is it specific to the user's device? For example, mobile users might be experiencing the pain point while tablet users don't. What about external factors from the user's environment that might impact the experience, such as working in a noisy coffee shop, or using the product in a dark room late at night?Or are there barriers that prevent users with a permanent, situational, or temporary disability from reaching their goal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing presenting UI designs. Let's begin by discussing how to plan your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUI designer Tess Gadd says don't present your work like a painting, present it like a building. After all, good architects don't make arbitrary choices. When presenting the designs for a building, they'll start from the blueprints and focus on practical considerations like what materials the building is made from, where the morning and afternoon sun will hit, or how many people can fit on each floor before it becomes a fire hazard. You'll want to approach presenting UI the same way, by focusing on the impact each design choice will have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you're planning your presentation, make sure you know who's in your audience. When presenting to stakeholders‚Äìin other words, anyone who has an interest in your project and influence over your decision-making‚Äìyou'll need to speak the language of business. Stakeholders might not know much about the design process, so it's your responsibility to connect your explanation of that process to their product division and business goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're instead presenting to teammates, keep their strengths and interests in mind. Developers, for example, will be interested in the technological feasibility, performance, and accessibility of your solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any design presentation, your UI design presentation should tell a cohesive story, one that begins with the problem you were solving for and ends with the benefits your designs have for both users and the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion. What if your audience contains both stakeholders and teammates? What strategies could help your presentation meet the needs of both groups? \u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"resources-information-design-ethics","title":"üìö Resources: Information Design Ethics","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/privacy-by-design-framework/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow To Protect Your Users With The Privacy By Design Framework\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/information-overload-why-it-matters-and-how-to-combat-it\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInformation Overload, Why it Matters and How to Combat It\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-concerns-ux-web-forms/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePrivacy UX: Common Concerns And Privacy In Web Forms\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/ux-security\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSafe by Design: An Overview of UX Security\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://codemotion.com/magazine/frontend/design-ux/ux-design-enhance-data-security/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e7 Ways to Use UX Design to Enhance User Data Security\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-dashboards-and-data-storytelling","title":"üé¨ Designing Dashboards | Dashboards \u0026 Data Storytelling","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Designing Dashboards | Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765863958?h=757e951097\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the connection between dashboard design and data storytelling? Let's find out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDashboards are a form of data communication. Data storytelling is a collection of skills and concepts that help improve data communication. To be effective, a dashboard needs to communicate clearly to its intended audience. It needs to be clear, concise, engaging, and organized. Dashboard should provide a consistent view of key metrics and trends that are important to the audience and should reflect the audience's priorities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelling an effective story with data using a dashboard can feel structurally similar to composing a three act play. We start by setting context. What can the audience learn from this data? Why is this meaningful? And why is this information credible? Next comes the heart of the story. The audience may need to be guided through the data to find insights relevant to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally during the resolution, the audience takes action. This could be a direct action, something that can be done right now based on the data. Or it might be an indirect action, in which the data helps the user make better decisions in the future.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, storytelling means more than just presenting data. Dashboards should set a context to explain why a chart is relevant, describe the chart so users can understand how to interpret it, guide the flow so users understand how to move forward, and highlight insights and actions so users remember key takeaways and have enough information to make thoughtful decisions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe individual metrics presented by your dashboard are the characters in your story. Deciding which metrics to emphasize in a data story can be complex, but the decision should be made based on the needs and priorities of your audience. Displaying only a few metrics at a time makes your story easier to understand, and makes it easier for your audience to identify the heroes or villains‚Äìthat is, the good or bad data points based on the user's strategic goals.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat visual storytelling components could you use in your dashboard to make the story accessible to people outside of your organization? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"resources-data-visualization","title":"üìö Resources: Data Visualization","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhat Is Data Visualization?

Let's find out. Author and motivational speaker Lily Walters says the success of your presentation will be judged not by the knowledge you send, but by what the listener receives. In other words, simply documenting a successful design project isn't enough.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to convince your audience your work matters to them, and deliver your most important insights in a way they'll remember later.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we look at some common components of an effective presentation, here's another discussion prompt. What makes a presentation compelling? Is your answer different for online presentations versus when you're in the room with the speaker?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's discuss what goes into an effective presentation. You'll want to use your early slides to let your audience know what you're presenting and why your presentation matters to them. What was your role? Who worked with you? What was the main problem you were trying to solve? As you move forward, explain the design process you took your project through, including the motivation for each step. Summarize key insights learned at each stage using a combination of prominent text, numbers, iconography, and visuals so the audience doesn't have to struggle to understand what's important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, conclude your presentation with the single most important takeaway. Include what you've learned and where you'd like the project to head next.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you design your slides, keep the number of words per slide to a minimum. Apple CEO Steve Jobs famously rehearsed his presentations so thoroughly that his slides often consisted of a single word or a single visual. If your audience is busy reading your slides, they're probably not listening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesigning visually compelling slides isn't enough on its own. A conversational tone keeps the audience engaged. Just as you can stress important takeaways visually, you can do the same with your voice. Now bear in mind that sounding both conversational and authoritative isn't something that comes naturally for most people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more you rehearse your presentation beforehand, the more confident you'll feel and sound. Finally, allow time for audience questions at the end, and do your best to anticipate questions your audience might ask you as part of your preparation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you explain your design process, keep in mind the level of knowledge your audience brings to the presentation. A room full of designers will recognize common design deliverables, so there's no need to define them. Just jump right in to why you did what you did and what you learned. Stakeholders, on the other hand, might need a bit more background information. And developers will be interested to hear your thoughts on implementing your designs, and whether you've kept technological feasibility in mind.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't forget the story you tell should constantly reinforce the reason you're giving the presentation. Are you sharing your vision? Educating the audience? Reporting on your progress? Trying to persuade your audience to follow a particular direction? Don't get so caught up in small details that your audience loses track of the big picture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, remember to respect your audience's attention span. Make sure your presentation is designed for the time slot you've been given and doesn't go over time. Vary your presentation methods a bit by saying more about some slides and less about others. Build in checks for understanding by asking questions of your audience or allowing them opportunities to participate. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"learning-objectives-the-designer-developer-handoff","title":"‚úÖ Learning Objectives: The Designer-Developer Handoff","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe best practices for setting up and annotating a design document for handoff to developers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eList the advantages of discussing technical constraints impacting design ideas\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain why a design system featuring reusable components increase design and development efficiency\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain the importance of providing designs and microcopy for all states of a product: focus, hover, empty states, success/failure messaging\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eList techniques for communicating accessibility features when preparing a design document for handoff\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrepare and annotate a design document for handoff to developers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"learning-objectives-product-strategy-basics","title":"‚úÖ Learning Objectives: Product Strategy Basics","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDefine information architecture as the organization of information within digital products\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecall that reducing the number of choices facing the user reduces cognitive load\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain why previewing information and showing examples of content helps users understand find what they‚Äôre seeking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecall that navigation and wayfinding should support users who enter via a different entry point than the homepage\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe the difference between global, local, and contextual navigation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnalyze content of a digital product using a sitemap diagram\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"storytelling-and-presenting-|-designing-your-slides","title":"üé¨ Storytelling and Presenting | Designing Your Slides","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.1 INTRO TO STORYTELLING AND PRESENTING Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/766167618?h=343989a5f5\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's talk about strategies for designing your slides. The slide on the left contains far too many words. Don't forget our storytelling advice: show, don't tell. If your topic is the glorious rings of Saturn, including a recognizable photo of Saturn allows you to remove a ton of text.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is also a reminder of the benefits of a well-rehearsed presentation. The more confident you feel about how you're going to describe each slide verbally, the fewer words you'll need on screen. Here we've removed even more text by identifying the most important takeaways within the body copy and visualized them using large text and iconography.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if your audience ignores the body text, the bold heading and highlighted key points give them plenty to remember.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember the five second test? Try it with the slide on the left. I'd be surprised if you remember much of anything after five seconds, apart from the photo of the planet Venus. The designer hasn't done the work to determine what information is most important,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand has instead placed the burden on the viewer. How about the same five second test with the slide on the right? Cutting away irrelevant data and providing a visualization with big bold numbers makes the information far easier to recall.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two slides contain the same information presented in roughly the same way, but it's much easier to read the slide on the right thanks to the generous white space. White space reduces visual tension and allows the viewer the opportunity to concentrate on one visual at a time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Creating transitions between sections of your presentation with a big, bold visual is helpful for a number of reasons. This technique captures attention while at the same time allowing both the audience and the presenter a few seconds to catch their breath before diving into a new set of information.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarying your slide layouts also keeps your presentation from growing too dull or repetitive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you design your slides, be thinking about how your audience will receive your presentation. Audiences for virtual presentations using video conferencing software generally have shorter attention spans and face more distractions than in-person audiences. On the other hand, if your presentation is being sent directly to your audience, meaning you won't be there to provide verbal context, you'll have to make each slide just a bit wordier so the slides can speak for themselves. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-types-of-dashboards","title":" üé¨ Designing Dashboards | Types of Dashboards","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Designing Dashboards | Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765863975?h=a3e5cf5112\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Not every dashboard serves the same function. Let's take a look at different types of dashboards. Operational dashboards are the most traditional and commonly used type of dashboard, presenting real time data of daily business operations. The main purpose of operational dashboards is to keep track of and evaluate how well ongoing processes and short-term operations are working.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn analytical dashboard presents data trends over time to help users make better decisions about the future. \u0026nbsp;While the initial view of an analytical dashboard tends to show data over months, quarters, or years, analytical dashboards are also typically highly interactive to enable deeper analysis. Analytical dashboards supply a business with a comprehensive overview of its data operations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrategic dashboards let the user track their main strategic goals via KPIs, or key performance indicators, as well as OKRs, or objectives and key results. Strategic dashboards are often used to compare the performance of individual departments against an overall longterm strategy and do so by comparing the current working period against past performance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether the dashboard you're designing is an operational, analytical, or strategic dashboard, you'll want to make sure your dashboard can adapt to the needs of the person using it. Two ways to do so are through personalization and customization. While these two terms sound similar, personalization describes content and functionality that matches specific user needs or interests with no effort from the user.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a dashboard uses geolocation to present information relevant to a user's current location, or adapts the display of information based on the user's role or previous activity, the system would be automatically personalizing the user's experience.

So returning to our example of a company selling running shoes, buying shoes isn't our customer's main job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's getting more exercise. The customer might have related objectives, such as running a certain distance each week. An emotional job might be to feel pride in meeting those running goals, or to avoid a family history of heart disease. And many jobs have a social component such as bragging about your improved physique on social media. Understanding the main, related, emotional, and social jobs customers want to get done is achieved through qualitative research methods, such as interviews and contextual observation. With the Jobs To Be Done framework, we can start looking for ways to systematically create value. The provided questions can help guide our search and keep us from missing opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great way to start is to think about the biggest problems with the current solutions. Can the job be executed in a more efficient or effective way? Do some customers struggle more with executing the job than others? In what contexts do customers most struggle with executing the job? To make our analysis work better, we want a team of experts from different fields like marketing, design, engineering, and even target customers to join this discussion.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"learning-objectives-design-across-devices","title":"‚úÖ Learning Objectives: Design Across Devices","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eList ways in which mobile usability differs from desktop usability\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIdentify a variety of input modalities (mouse, touch, keyboard, speech, gesture) and list usability and accessibility considerations for each\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe challenges that occur when users transition between devices or input modalities to complete a task\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eList strategies for providing a consistent, continuous, and complementary experience across devices\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eList strategies for presenting content in an efficient manner appropriate for the user‚Äôs device and context\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain the role of design systems and UI kits in creating a cohesive experience\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDesign for an experience or task flow that can be completed in stages, using multiple devices or input modalities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"resources-jobs-to-be-done","title":"üìö Resources: Jobs to Be Done","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-jobs-be-done/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePersonas vs. Jobs-to-Be-Done\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/personas-vs-jtbd/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePersonas vs. Jobs-To-Be-Done: What‚Äôs The Difference And When To Use Them\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/jobs-to-be-done-framework\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInnovate with Purpose: An Overview of the Jobs to Be Done Framework\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://pony.studio/design-for-growth/jobs-to-be-done-how-to-start-examples\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJobs to be Done: The First 3 Steps + Practical Examples to Help You Get Started\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/defined/jobs-to-be-done\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJobs to be done | InVision Blog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eüé¨ Videos\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQFUHapOJsQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"accelerometer;

In this series of lectures, we'll be discussing information design ethics. Let's start with protecting the user's right to access information. In the words of author, instructor, and communication designer, Jorge Frascara, access to information should be regarded as a human right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation design should not be seen as an option, but a necessity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could use this slide as a checklist to measure the respectfulness of your information design. Information design respects people when it focuses on user needs, when it's ethical and practical, when it's been made accessible for all types of users, when it's been designed attractively, and when it's relevant to the user's area of interest.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe information we provide should be readable, understandable, complete, accurate, timely, and usable. We should consider how people interact with our designs and double check that we didn't confuse, harm, or mislead the user, but that we instead provided straightforward information that could be used to inform decision-making.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pyramid on screen demonstrates that while delighting the user is important, it's only the capstone of a respectful experience. The foundation of the respectful design pyramid is human rights and it depends on protecting user privacy and security, being open and honest, meeting accessibility requirements, and designing products that are environmentally sustainable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the foundation of the pyramid we see a level labeled human effort, which speaks to minimizing the effort users need to access our information. The products and services we design should be functional, convenient, and reliable. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"resources-behavioral-design","title":"üìö Resources: Behavioral Design","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/how-to-use-mental-models-in-ux-design/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow to Use Mental Models in UX Design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMental Models and User Experience Design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://designmuseumfoundation.org/art-of-designing-for-behavior-change/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Art of Designing for Behavior Change\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://blinkux.com/ideas/how-design-nudges-can-effect-behavior-change\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHow Nudges in Design Can Effect Behavior Change\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/01/combining-ux-design-and-psychology-to-change-user-behavior/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCombining UX Design And Psychology To Change User Behaviour\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\"\u003eüìó Chapters\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe author, Stephen Wendel, has given us permission to use Chapter 9 and 10 from his excellent book, \u003cem\u003eDesigning for Behavior Change\u003c/em\u003e, 2nd edition.

Minimum viable products are central to the Lean UX cycle, which consists of Think, Make, Check. In the Think stage, design teams think of a new hypothesis based on assumptions made about the needs and behaviors of the target audience. In the Make stage, design teams create an MVP to place in front of target users during the Check stage. Designers then take what they've learned and repeat the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou shouldn't be spending any more time making things than thinking or checking. Building an MVP means doing just enough work to test your hypothesis with users. In his book The Lean Startup, author Eric Ries defines MVP as that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. Note the emphasis on \"least effort.\" Doing as little work as possible isn't lazy. It's lean. The faster you find out whether your hypothesis is worth pursuing, the less you invest in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes changing directions much easier, which increases the agility of your team. MVPs can vary in fidelity depending on the stage of your project and what exactly you're hoping to learn about your users. If color, typeface choice, iconography, and imagery are central to the question you're asking, a high fidelity MVP may be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, work with the lowest fidelity MVP possible. Remember, the sooner you can place your MVP in front of target users, the sooner you'll know whether your idea is something you should continue working on. Low fidelity methods like paper prototypes are the most efficient way to explore concepts quickly and discard unusable ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital wireframes take longer to create than paper prototypes, but they require less imagination from users when it comes to their functionality. Wireframe prototypes are also generally easier to test remotely than paper prototypes. A landing page is a single webpage that appears in response to clicking a marketing promotion, a marketing email, or an online advertisement. Landing pages present information relevant to the viewer and a clear call to action. Landing pages can make effective MVPs because you don't have to create the rest of the website to gauge interest in your idea. Creating a simple landing page for a non-existent product can generate feedback and measure user enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat kind of conversation should determine what an MVP looks like?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWho should be present at that conversation?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCan you think of any situations where an MVP might take another form other than the methods discussed in this lecture?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"behavioral-design-|-what-is-behavioral-design","title":"üé¨ Behavioral Design | What is Behavioral Design?","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.4 BEHAVIORAL DESIGN Part 01\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/774008448?h=7c947d2b3c\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello, my name is Anwar and I'm part of the Product Design curriculum team here at Flatiron School. In this series of lectures we'll be discussing behavioral design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's get started by defining behavioral design.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBehavioral design is an ethical framework for understanding and systematically influencing human behaviors in physical and digital environments. In the words of journalists and content strategist Jory MacKay, behavioral design focuses on change, not coercion. It emphasizes helping users achieve their own goals while using your product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe've discussed previously that using techniques like Nir Eyal's Hook Model and addictive patterns such as infinite scroll to create unwanted habits in users is ethically problematic. But what if users want to change their behavior?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a prompt for discussion. What apps have you used to try to break an old habit or build a new one? What was the experience like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's look at some examples of behavioral design. One common category of behavioral design products is language acquisition apps. Duolingo encourages users to build daily language learning habits through a combination of positive encouragement and celebrating streaks of daily engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsers might also use an application to help them form money saving habits and meet financial goals. Mint allows users to create a custom budgeting goal, then offers guidance on how to distribute paychecks, budget, and reduce spending to achieve that goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany behavioral design products focus on improving user health and wellbeing. Fitbit supports a user's health journey using a system of notifications aimed at increasing physical activity, improving daily nutrition intake, and building better sleep habits. \u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"presenting-ux-designs-|-editing-your-story","title":"üé¨ Presenting UX Designs | Editing Your Story","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.3 PRESENTING UX DESIGNS Part 01.mp4\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837686?h=b6dbce4fbe\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‚ÄäHello, my name is Anwar and I'm part of the Product Design curriculum team here at Flatiron School. In this series of lectures we'll be discussing presenting UX designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery good design presentation needs to tell a clear story. But how do we edit that story so our audience can connect with it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's a prompt for discussion. Who attends a UX design presentation? What do they want to know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an article called Defending UX Design Decisions, UX designer and researcher Chris Kiess says, \"if you are going to successfully sell or defend your design, you have to involve those who do not push pixels and make them feel as though they are part of the process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout careful editing, even the most interesting story will fail to hold the attention of your audience. As an example, imagine something really exciting happened during your commute this morning, and you can't wait to tell your coworkers about it. Yet when they ask what happened, you begin with, \"I grabbed my backpack, wallet and keys. Then I made sure the front door was locked. I walked the five blocks to Broadway, stopping at my favorite coffee cart on the way. My bus wasn't due until 8:35, so I read the news for a bit on my phone.\" This may accurately describe your commute, but you can bet your coworkers will have tuned out by the time your story gets to the good part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, the story of your UX design process requires editing before you present it. There's no question the design process is time consuming and you might be tempted to present the whole thing, step-by-step. But will your audience still be listening by the time you reach the part that impacts them? Instead of reciting what you did, focus on why you took certain steps and how those steps were meaningful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if a presentation shouldn't cover every last detail, how should designers shape their story? Here's a five step framework you can use to organize your UX design presentation. Start by introducing the project. Then set context, explain your process, and present your solution. And finally, conclude your presentation and suggest next steps to take. We'll take a closer look at how to use this framework in future videos.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"information-design-|-data-vs-information","title":"üé¨ Information Design | Data vs. Information","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.1 INFORMATION DESIGN Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765854981?h=a0c24c242c\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre data and information the same thing? And if not, what makes them different? Let's find out. In this example, we see a spreadsheet full of sales records. One table is labeled Sales and another is labeled Quota. Is this data meaningful to you? Or how about this example? This time we see assorted figures related to different United States counties for the year 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you learn from scanning the figures? Are you able to interpret the data from reading it? If the last two slides didn't mean much of anything, you're not alone. Data without context, labels, or organization is meaningless. When designers add context and organization to data, they convert that data into information\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat can be used and acted upon by the viewer. Converting data into information starts with grouping related data and providing meaningful labels so viewers can understand what they're seeing and quickly find what they're looking for. If your data is interactive, it helps to provide filters so viewers can isolate the data most meaningful to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also highlight trends or averages within the data, if that helps the viewer understand it faster. According to a 2009 report by the University of California, San Diego, the average American consumes 34 gigabytes of data each day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're having trouble visualizing what 34 gigabytes looks like, well, that's exactly my point. Data only truly becomes valuable when it is structured and actionable. Cognitive overload happens all too easily on the web. The more we ask users to do the hard work of converting data into information, the harder it becomes for them to make a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling attention to what's important within a set of information reduces fatigue and leads to better informed choices. On the screen, we see two dates in November 2020 that at a glance look pretty similar to each other. The column on the left features the dates alone. What do you learn from this column?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you said, not much, I'm inclined to agree with you. In the column on the right, each data is supported by a bit of colorful text. What do you learn from this column? Here we see that whatever it was that was due on November 6th is now one day overdue, while whatever was due on November 10th isn't due for three more days. In this case, it was a pretty subtle change that turned unprocessed data into actionable information.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"resources-designing-dashboards","title":"üìö Resources: Designing Dashboards","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.justinmind.com/blog/dashboard-design-best-practices-ux-ui/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDashboard Design: best practices and examples\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/dashboard-ui-ux-design/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e7 Tips for Dashboard UX/UI Design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/dashboard-design-research-decluttering-data-viz/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFrom Good To Great In Dashboard Design: Research, Decluttering And Data Viz\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/filter-categories-values/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDefining Helpful Filter Categories and Values for Better UX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-dashboard-design-pitfalls","title":" üé¨ Designing Dashboards | Dashboard Design Pitfalls","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Designing Dashboards | Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765863939?h=5225f90bbb\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat pitfalls should designers avoid when creating dashboards? When designing dashboards, marketing strategist Eleanor Taylor says the challenge is not to add new features, but to add value and power to products without adding any complexity. In other words, don't add features just to have them. \u0026nbsp;Calculate the value each feature offers the user, and whether you're helping users answer key questions and navigate data to find meaning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you've heard of the five second test, a rapid usability test in which participants are given only five seconds to view a design before answering questions about what they remember. This technique measures how quickly a design communicates a message. If users can't remember how their most important metrics are performing after viewing your dashboard for five seconds, that's a good indication you've made it too cluttered.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse caution when adding animations and 3D effects to your dashboard visualizations. Motion should be purposeful, indicating a direction of change or leading users towards the answer to their question. 3D effects should be applied sparingly, if at all, as they can make charts harder to read and distort comparisons within datasets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColor should also be applied purposefully. Too many colors creates visual noise and makes your content hard to read and understand. Also, as with any data visualization, avoid relying on color alone to communicate meaning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile designers should strive for a clean dashboard layout with plenty of white space and effective visual hierarchy, be aware of making your design so minimal that your information lacks context. Users need enough labels to find meaning and spot trends in the data, as well as to indicate what their interactive options are on each screen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as with any visual design, you can't make everything on a dashboard screen important. Guide the user's eye to key information. Embrace progressive disclosure: reserve less important information and advanced features for secondary screens.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLack of contrast will lead to users struggling to accurately interpret the information in front of them. While you'll want to make sure your colors meet contrast standards outlined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, you'll also need to make sure you've applied contrast meaningfully to your design so users don't miss the point of your visual. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"learning-objectives-structuring-content","title":"‚úÖ Learning Objectives: Structuring Content","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe the role of taxonomies in organizing and classifying information\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe the difference between flat, hierarchical, network, and facet taxonomies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDefine metadata and list strategies for gathering, classifying, and organizing metadata\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eList the benefits of offering several different classification schemes to browse content\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain the benefits of using simple, concise navigation labels and following standardized naming conventions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIdentify, classify, and organize metadata using an appropriate taxonomy\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"jobs-to-be-done-|-job-maps","title":"üé¨ Jobs to Be Done | Job Maps","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.2 JOBS TO BE DONE Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765841510?h=f0b2d23635\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's take a look at the role Job Maps play within the Jobs To Be Done framework. A Job Map is a visual depiction of the customer's main job that explains step by step exactly what they are trying to get done. Mapping out the job enables teams to not only think of what can be done to support the customer's journey, but also identify places where customer needs are overlooked and customers face an unsatisfying experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of creating a Job Map is not to find out how the customer actually executes a job, as that only generates maps of existing activities and solutions. Instead, the aim is to discover what the customer is trying to get done at different points in executing a job and what must happen at each step in order for the job to be carried out successfully. The first four steps here‚Äì\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edefine the objective, locate and prepare tools for completing the task, and confirm readiness‚Äìare preparatory steps a customer takes in order to execute a job. After execution, the customer will monitor the results, make modifications as needed, and conclude the task. A Job Map is not a customer journey, service blueprint, or workflow diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt does not reflect what a person does to discover, learn about, select, buy, and use a product or service. It instead focuses on customer needs and describes what they are trying to get done independent of any specific solution. When companies focus on jobs customers need to get done, they can use Job Maps to break jobs into steps and find innovation opportunities that are the key to growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these innovation opportunities can be found by asking meaningful questions while examining each individual step within a Job Map. Do some customers struggle more than others with this step? Is this step more difficult to execute successfully in some contexts than others? What are the biggest drawbacks of current solutions used to execute this step?\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"resources-presenting-ui-+-annotating-your-work","title":"üìö Resources: Presenting UI + Annotating your work","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003ch2\u003eüîó Articles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dribbble.com/stories/2019/07/22/11-tips-for-pitching-your-ui-ux-designs-to-non-designers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e11 tips for presenting your UI/UX designs to non‚Äëdesigners \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/ui-styleguide-better-ux\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCreating a UI Style Guide for Better UX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/11/creating-a-ux-design-style-guide.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCreating a UX Design Style Guide\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/create-design-system-guide/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDesign Systems: Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your Own\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"designing-dashboards-|-what-is-a-dashboard","title":"üé¨ Designing Dashboards | What is a Dashboard?","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"Designing Dashboards | Part 01\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765863988?h=1de5f45639\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello.

In this series of lectures we'll be discussing designing dashboards.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what is a dashboard? According to Stephen Few, author of a book called Information Dashboard Design, a dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's an example. The YouTube studio dashboard brings up the most meaningful creator stats at a glance, including watch time, views, subscribers, top videos, and latest activity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat dashboards communicate information quickly, display information clearly and efficiently, show trends and changes in data over time, and are easily customizable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen designing a dashboard, it's impossible to make all the data a user could possibly need available upfront. Instead, it's critical to identify the most important information and create a clear visual hierarchy to make that information understandable, meaningful, and usable. Provide additional links and filters so users have the opportunity to drill down for more details. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"learning-objectives-working-with-software-engineers","title":"‚úÖ Learning Objectives: Working With Software Engineers","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain each of Apple‚Äôs Human Interface Guidelines design themes: clarity, deference, depth\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe the benefits of understanding the expectations of iOS users and using interaction patterns that iOS users recognize\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDescribe the difference between skeuomorphic and flat design, and list usability considerations for each\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eList examples of common iOS navigation patterns and explain the guidelines for implementation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExplain the usability benefits of using system fonts and system icons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApply iOS interaction patterns and design kits to an interface\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"bar-charts-histograms-and-pie-charts","title":"Bar Charts, Histograms, and Pie Charts","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eBar Charts\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eA \u003cstrong\u003ebar chart\u003c/strong\u003e uses rectangular bars to make numerical comparisons between independent categories of data.

Let's take a look.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo design for behavior change, we need to first consider how users make decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his textbook \u003cem\u003eDesigning For Behavior Change: Applying Psychology and Behavioral Economics\u003c/em\u003e, author Stephen Wendel says that when we understand the obstacles people face, we can help them take action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWendel introduces the CREATE framework to describe the mental process of making a decision. He describes each step in the framework ‚Äì cue, reaction, evaluation, ability, timing, and experience ‚Äì as tests the human brain uses to determine whether an action is worth pursuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider a choice many of us face daily, whether to use the elevator or stairs. What would the CREATE framework say about making this decision?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cue is something that captures our attention. We're constantly accomplishing tasks without cues. These are tasks we pay no conscious attention to. Think about chatting with a coworker and unthinkingly following them onto an elevator. Sometimes external cues trigger our decision-making process. A sign indicating one of the building's two elevators is out of service might make us wonder whether waiting for the other elevator is worth it. Internal cues happen within the user's mind. Perhaps we remembered reading an article the other day indicating that taking the stairs, boosts our heart health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur brains are built to do most problem solving using System One thinking, which is fast and automatic. If we're used to taking the elevator every day, we might board the elevator as an unconscious reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we haven't boarded the elevator unconsciously, our brains can use System Two thinking to evaluate the costs and benefits of using the stairs. System Two thinking is slower and involves conscious effort. When evaluating our decision, we might focus on highlighting the benefits of the stairs, as the activity provides exercise. Or we might minimize the costs, reminding ourselves that taking the stairs is only a few minutes slower than the elevator. We might also downplay the alternatives. If the elevator is crowded and slow at lunchtime, this can make the stairs seem more appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth step in the CREATE decision-making framework is assessing whether we have the ability ‚Äì in other words, the knowledge, skills, resources, and belief in success ‚Äì to complete the action right now. If we're injured, we might need a resource to help us climb the stairs, such as a cane, a crutch, or a friend to carry our backpack. Or if we haven't been active lately, we might not believe ourselves capable of climbing multiple flights of stairs until we've mastered a smaller challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally the timing of a decision comes with a pressing external urgency. The decision of whether to do our taxes now or later comes with an April 15th deadline and penalties if we're late. However, most other actions can be put off until tomorrow. Even if we'd like to exercise more by taking the stairs, we might decide not to start today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur past experience with an action has a powerful impact on whether we'll have the confidence to try it again. If someone made fun of you for climbing the stairs too slowly, or if you've slipped on the stairs and gotten hurt, these negative experiences might make you reluctant to try it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's time for a workshop activity. A friend sent you an invite to Duolingo, and you've always wanted to learn a new language.

Are we ready to begin designing? Not yet. Let's examine the process designers go through when approaching a data visualization. Before you begin designing, you need to know who you're designing for. How familiar is your audience with your topic?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat decisions are your audience responsible for making? Are they comfortable with a complex chart, or will they need a simple presentation? Do they need precise numbers or just a general idea of an overall trend? Also, consider the context in which your audience will encounter your visual. Is it part of a presentation or will they be able to interact with the data and apply filters?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext decide on the story you need to tell. Remember, more data isn't always better. Figure out what your audience needs to know and how you want them to respond after encountering your visualization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's look at some examples. In 2014, the Washington Post created an online visual colored by a gradient from light to dark blue that required a ton of vertical scrolling to view as it was nearly 17,000 pixels tall. Why? Officials were searching for the wreckage of a missing Malaysian airliner some 15,000 feet beneath the surface of the ocean. Since most people can't visualize what 15,000 feet looks like, the visual tells the story, \"how deep is the ocean?\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, the website 538 used a scatter plot to diagram California's annual precipitation and average temperature from 1895 to 2018. Why? To answer the question, \"is California getting hotter and drier?\" While the dots representing 1895 to 1999 are scattered at random. The dots representing 2000 through 2018 clearly trend towards hot and dry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData journalist Mona Chalabi created a bar chart using various sizes of folded up $1 bills. Why? To tell a story of income inequality. For every $1 a white man earns, Native American and Hispanic women earn less than 60 cents.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third step in preparing to visualize a set of data is to double-check it. If you didn't gather your own data, you need to check where it came from. In Chalabi's case, she used the 2015 United States census report. If you can't find the original source of your data, if you're uncertain of the trustworthiness of the source, or if you're not sure what methods were used to gather the data, don't use it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you're certain you're working with trustworthy data, you need to choose just the right amount. Faced with a table of data, it might be tempting to use all of it A visual representing income inequality in the United States could include the number of children in each family, for example, as that information is available in the census report. But would that information have helped tell a clear story? Or just cluttered the visualization?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you know your audience, decide on your story, double-check and prepare your data, you'll finally be ready to select the most meaningful and appropriate chart or graphic.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhen you encounter a data visualization, how do you decide whether or not to trust it?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eHow can designers make sure the audience trusts their visualizations? \u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"presenting-ux-designs-|-explain-your-process","title":"üé¨ Presenting UX Designs | Explain Your Process","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.3 PRESENTING UX DESIGNS Part 04\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/770837785?h=07ab8160ff\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you've introduced your project and set the context for your audience, you're ready to explain your design process. But doing so is not as simple as just describing everything you did, step-by-step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour audience wants to hear what you learned, not what you did. In other words, you're not here to present a complete list of the tasks you accomplished. You're here to present insights gained from performing those tasks in a way that helps stakeholders better understand the needs of target users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully you recognize some variation of this graphic. You should be aware that design is an iterative process that includes empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing. But here's the thing: your UX design presentation audience doesn't really care. You might sometimes refer to the design process to justify a particular experiment. We needed to prototype this specific feature to learn this information about our users. But it's not necessary to provide exhaustive detail on every step of the process‚Äìespecially if a particular step didn't impact the project outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking about what aspects of your design process to include, highlight the parts that accomplish one or more of the following. The task you're presenting might reveal insights about your user, allowing stakeholders to better understand the user's needs and motivations. Or maybe you've uncovered a chance to meet business goals or do something better than the competition. A particular test might've confirmed an earlier assumption, or perhaps it disproved an assumption and forced your team to change directions. Above all, think about each step you include as something intended to inspire confidence in your design solution. If an experiment you ran or a deliverable you created doesn't do any of the above, it's best to leave it out of your presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, suppose you conducted an open card sort. When presenting the results, highlight the issues users were having with the existing information architecture that made the card sort necessary. While you might briefly explain how the card sort workshop was executed, you likely wouldn't show a spreadsheet of the workshop results, since spreadsheets are not easy for presentation audiences to understand. Instead focus on the results of the card sort. Do you better understand your user's mental model for how your content is organized? Was a preexisting hypothesis confirmed or invalidated? What should happen next based on the results?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr if you tested a paper prototype, your setup should focus on why low fidelity made sense at this stage, as well as your hypothesis and what you hoped to learn. Then highlight the results of your usability tests, which could include direct quotes or videos. Finally, conclude with takeaways and present the impact the results of the test had on the project direction moving forward. \u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"design-for-scanning-not-reading","title":"Design For Scanning, Not Reading","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eHow users read on the web\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eA frequently-referenced \u003ca href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e1997 study by the Nielsen Norman Group\u003c/a\u003e offers a flippantly accurate two-word response to the question of how users read on the web: they don‚Äôt.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe idea isn‚Äôt that users never read, or that users avoid information that requires reading.

My name is Anwar \u0026nbsp;and I'm part of the Product Design curriculum team here at \u0026nbsp;Flatiron School. In this series of lectures, we'll be discussing the Jobs To Be Done framework. Let's start with a discussion question. What would motivate you to buy a drill?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe some of you would buy one just to have one, just in case, or to have your tool set feel more complete. But most people buy drills when they're looking to build something. In the words of Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt, people don't want to buy a quarter inch drill. They want a quarter inch hole.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, sometimes it's helpful to look beyond the immediate step facing users and see it as part of a larger process for achieving a more meaningful goal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, \u0026nbsp;Ikea bought TaskRabbit, \u0026nbsp;one of the best known startups in the gig economy that connects freelance labor with local demand, allowing consumers to find help with everyday tasks. Why did Ikea start offering furniture assembly by TaskRabbit ? Because they recognized that Ikea customers aren't motivated by assembling furniture.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey want to be organized, express their individuality, and feel comfortable in their home.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Jobs To Be Done framework, we analyze why people hire products, services, software, and ideas, and then discover innovative opportunities to grow.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jobs To Be Done framework helps us identify the outcomes users ultimately hope to accomplish when hiring a product or service. Understanding customer needs from their point of view helps us pinpoint new opportunities. Clayton Christensen, author of the Jobs To Be Done framework, illustrates this with a story he calls \"hiring a milkshake\".\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy observing customers who bought milkshakes from fast food restaurants, Christiansen discovered many customers wanted a treat they could enjoy one-handed during a long and dull drive to work. Once we recognize what jobs customers ultimately want the milkshakes to fulfill, we can make thicker milkshakes that lasts for a longer portion of the commute.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how does one use the Jobs To Be Done framework? The first step is to identify the jobs customers are actually hoping to accomplish. If a customer wants to purchase running shoes, what is the main job to be done?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you said to go running regularly, that's not bad, but we might categorize that as a related job to our customer's main job: to get more exercise and get healthy. Knowing that helps us realize that our competition extends beyond direct competitors, like other running shoe brands. Customers could also get more exercise with a bike, or a jump rope, or a set of weights.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we've defined our competition, we can determine our criteria for success. How will we measure how satisfied customers are with our proposed solution? Finally, we'll create desired outcome statements, which provide insight about the things customers value most. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"presenting-ux-to-non-designers","title":"Presenting UX to Non-Designers","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eUnderstand your audience\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eDuring your time at school, you might get used to presenting to an audience of team members.

Keep in mind that just because you completed a deliverable doesn't mean it automatically belongs in your presentation. With each deliverable, ask yourself, will my audience understand why this deliverable is relevant to the problem I'm trying to solve? Did this help me test the effectiveness of my solution with target users? Is this moving my story towards a meaningful conclusion? If not, leave it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you've decided what imagery to include, think about how to best present it. In the image on screen, we see a closeup of a dropdown navigation being interacted with, illustrating that it's not always necessary to include a screenshot of the entire layout. Especially when your work focuses on one small part of the interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen demonstrating a specific improvement to a user interface, it often helps to show the old and improved version side-by-side. While the designer of the mobile interface on screen has separated the most critical link visually to indicate its importance, without comparing this change to the previous design, the impact of the improvement might be hard to grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use this technique of comparing old and improved versions to demonstrate accessibility improvements to your interface as well. For example, interface elements that are too small or too close together can cause issues for users with motor skills disabilities. The image on screen visualizes the benefits of adjusting an interface to meet the WCAG target size recommendation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareless slide design can make even the most polished UI designs look underwhelming or ineffective. The principles of visual hierarchy, white space, grid, and type hierarchy matter just as much when designing slides as they do when creating a user interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA consistent layout from slide to slide reduces cognitive load for viewers and keeps attention focused on the most important content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can additionally reduce cognitive load by sticking to one idea per slide. Include just enough words, imagery, and data on each slide to get a single, memorable point across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe cautious about over-designing your slides. If viewers are paying more attention to the design of your slide than the actual content, that's a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, respect the client's style guide while designing your slides. Keep the color, type, spacing, and iconography you apply to each slide consistent with the existing style guide or design system. If your client doesn't have one, create your own rough style guide and stick to it. \u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"presenting-research-|-sharing-research-findings","title":" üé¨ Presenting Research | Sharing Research Findings","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"12.2 PRESENTING RESEARCH Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/766167567?h=9311d8d2f3\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's take a closer look at some best practices for sharing research findings.

Why does this research matter right now? What were we hoping to learn?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefer back to this final question‚Äìwhat were we hoping to learn‚Äìfrequently. Any research data that isn't relevant to the project goal should be left out of your presentation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, briefly summarize your team's research methodology. Take a moment to remind your audience of what research activities took place, why these methods were chosen, how they were conducted, and who participated. When planning your next research project, by the way, don't forget the value of participatory design.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;If it's possible to bring stakeholders to research activities, or even invite their participation, they'll feel engaged and offer feedback along the way.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen presenting relevant data, command attention with big, bold facts and figures that are easy to read and easy to remember. \u0026nbsp;Then provide pertinent details or evidence to support your main points. The data you highlight should be connected back to your original hypothesis and should shine a spotlight on recurring trends and themes. Visualize data so your audience can make sense of it quickly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting users state insights in their own words is often more powerful than stating them yourself. You can include user quotes in your presentation, or even short videos from research sessions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;In fact, one method of sharing insights called Atomic Research insists on pairing every insight with a short video of a target user talking about or demonstrating the experience. In Atomic Research, reports and slide decks are replaced with individual insights called nuggets that are linked to supporting video evidence and tagged by category.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour user research efforts may produce a variety of deliverables, including a competitive analysis, personas, user journey maps, affinity diagrams, and storyboards. However, these deliverables don't all need to be in your presentation. Before deciding to include a research artifact, remind yourself of who your audience is and what they want to know.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the deliverable doesn't help your audience understand the user, or the product, or the problem statement, leave it out. Include a brief summary of the findings instead.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen concluding your presentation, circle back to your original set of questions. Did your team learn what it needed to? Of your testable assumptions, which were validated, and which were invalidated? In addition, include suggestions for what should happen next. How might this research impact future decision-making?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs additional research needed?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you're wondering whether it's okay to admit shortcomings of your research project, the answer is yes. All user research methods have potential drawbacks. If your research took place remotely, for example, you might have a limited understanding of the participant's use context.

Goal- directed design places heavy emphasis on the end goals users hope to achieve. Activities and tasks are intermediate steps that help someone reach a goal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActivity- centered design is a design model that looks how activities in a system lead to results. The focus is not just on the user, but on the whole system.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a customer journey map, a hierarchical task analysis diagram starts with a goal and a scenario and then shows the most critical tasks needed to reach the goal. In user experience, these tasks are called operations. Designers can consider the overall number of tasks, the frequency of a task occurring,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe cognitive complexity and physical requirements involved in completing a task, and the time each task takes to complete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's look at a real- life Jobs To Be Done case study. In 2015, the year Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey reassumed \u0026nbsp;the position of CEO, the company posted a loss of over $500 million. Under Dorsey's leadership, twitter identified that the company had become overly reactive to innovations by tech industry peers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey used the Jobs To Be Done framework to focus on just three core customer jobs: keeping up to date on the news, holding conversations, and getting paid. By prioritizing these three tasks users hire Twitter to do and defining measurable outcomes related to those tasks, Twitter's revenue increased to above $4 billion in 2021.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen implementing the Jobs To Be Done framework, it's worth considering whether the customer's ultimate goal is to complete a straightforward task, or whether the goal is longer- term behavioral change. If the job is to complete a task, we can measure success by the completion of each activity. However, if the goal is long-term behavior change, we measure success in terms of progress towards that goal. If the customer's goal in preparing dinner is motivated by being thoughtful, we can call this a \"be\" goal, with a customer focus on behavioral change while working towards an ideal self. We interpret this differently than a \"do\" goal such as preparing dinner to satisfy immediate hunger.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we examine \"be\" goals, note that success isn't dependent on completion of an activity. Even if the dinner you made for a loved one is cooked badly, you might still feel more thoughtful afterwards. You might also switch activities next time by writing a poem or buying flowers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do\" goals and \"be\" goals are both useful in the design process.

What considerations do designers use to select one?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in picking the right visualization is knowing who your audience is and what knowledge they already have. If your topic is baseball, for example, you would design differently for hardcore, stat-obsessed fantasy players than you would for casual fans who only tune in for the World Series.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, you need to decide what story you want to tell your audience and what question your audience might have in mind that your visualization is intended to answer. With that in mind, let's look at some different chart types.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBar graphs show comparisons between different categories of data. If the four employees of my company respectively sold $400, $700, $500, and $1000 worth of goods this month, I could use a bar graph like the one on the left to compare their performances. When labeling the numeric axis of a bar graph, which in this case would be sales amounts in dollars, always start the axis at zero. Otherwise you risk distorting the comparison being made. Line graphs, on the other hand, show changes in data over time. If my team sold 20 units in January, 40 in February, 35 in March, 45 in April, and 65 in May, I could visualize my team's performance over these five months using a line graph like the one on the right. Unlike bar graphs, line graphs sometimes label a numeric axis starting with a number other than zero. It depends on what's appropriate for the type of data you're using.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScatter plots help users understand the correlation, or strength of relationship, between two different variables. If I were making paper airplanes and wanted to determine whether there was a relationship between the weight of the paper and the distance the airplane traveled, I could chart each paper airplane's weight and performance on a scatter plot.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter diagramming the data, I would analyze the correlation between the variables. Looking at the scatter plot on the left, I would say the relationship is positive, since the dots create a path from the lower left to the upper right, and linear, since they form a straight line rather than a curved one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe correlation is somewhat weak, however, since lots of dots are outliers, meaning they don't follow the general pattern. A flow chart as seen on the right is a diagram that shows a step-by-step progression through a system or process.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePie charts show percentages of a whole. If 60% of my class got an A this term, 25% got a B, 10% got a C, and 5% got a D, I could visualize class performance using a pie chart, like the one on the left. Just make sure your numbers add up to 100%. When working with small sets of data, you can use pictogram charts, also known as pictographs, such as the one on the right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePictographs reduce the amount of reading by using icons to represent data. If one of my employees sold 4 cars today and another sold 2, I could represent their performance by using 4 and 2 car icons, respectively. Pictographs don't work well with large data sets, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenn diagrams use overlapping circles to represent the relationship between sets of data. A Gantt chart is a unique type of bar chart depicting a project schedule from start to finish.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHierarchy diagrams show hierarchical relationships progressing from top to bottom. These might be used to show the structure of a business organization, with a CEO at the top and upper management at the next level. Hierarchical diagrams also feature in information architecture in the form of site map diagrams.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaps help users visualize distribution, location, and impact of data in a geographic environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many other types of visualizations not listed here. And you'll encounter others as you learn more about data visualization. The important thing to remember is don't select your visualization type first. Figure out what you want your audience to know, and how you'd like them to respond after viewing your visualization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen make your choice from there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for best practices while making your visualization, always keep your specific audience in mind. Create visual hierarchy to draw attention to the most important information, and label your visualization clearly. Aim for simplicity and conciseness, which also means only including the data you absolutely need to tell your story.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd do provide hierarchy, context, and contrast with your color choice. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"information-design-ethics-|-consumption-of-information","title":"üé¨ Information Design Ethics | Consumption of Information","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.2 INFORMATION DESIGN ETHICS Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765864066?h=8648ebca02\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's talk about how today's users consume information.

It consumes the attention of its recipients. The second is from singer Tom Waits, who says we are buried beneath the weight of information, which is being confused with knowledge;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equantity is being confused with abundance and wealth with happiness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to a 2012 book by Clay A. Johnson called The Information Diet, users spend 11 out of every 24 hours consuming information. This includes traditional media sources such as television, newspapers, and magazines, but also websites, social media feeds, and text and instant messaging. To quote the author, \"just as too much junk food can lead to obesity, too much junk information can lead to cluelessness\".\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what can users do to filter out empty, meaningless data and find nutritious, useful information?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat motivates the way people consume information? Sometimes we seek information to help us solve a problem or make a decision. Information consumption has a social aspect as well, as we want to appear knowledgeable and share information that supports our point of view with our peers. And of course, curiosity plays a role as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe might desire knowledge for the sake of knowledge, but we might also be tempted to respond to clickbait, a term describing a sensationalized headline or article snippet designed to draw attention.

Who is responsible for the authenticity, fidelity and accuracy of information?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho owns information as well as the channels through which information is transmitted?

Doctors and lawyers both commit to upholding a code of ethics, and a serious enough violation can result in a loss of the license to practice medicine or law. Do you think designers should be held to a similar standard?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Mike Monteiro, the co-founder and design director of Mule Design, published an influential essay called A Designer's Code of Ethics in which he states when we knowingly produce work that is intended to harm, we are abdicating our responsibility. When we ignorantly produce work that harms others because we didn't consider the full ramifications of that work, we are doubly guilty.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudies show that graphic warning labels on cigarette packs increase the likelihood of quitting tobacco, as the warnings provide behavioral nudges to remind smokers about the health risks associated with smoking. Attempting to increase profits for your stakeholder does not mean designers can overlook user safety.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating ethical designs means presenting a complete set of information upfront and letting users make their own judgment based on that information.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about how much data your devices collect about your habits. Did your apps provide a warning as to how your data would be used? Did you consent to having your data collected? Are you confident your data will be kept private and secure? Do you believe any of your data could be used unethically against you?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, Uber paid a $148 million settlement due to its poor data privacy practices.

The conversion of data into information provides just the foundation for this visual known as the DIKW or data, information, knowledge, and wisdom pyramid. We've done our job as information designers when users can convert that information into knowledge, meaning they can use it to make decisions. Even better, that knowledge can bring wisdom, or the ability to apply knowledge to real life situations and predict future outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we see a site map diagram for an informational website. Information architecture helps structure information and makes users more confident in the actions they take when locating information within a system. A customer journey map helps you design information with the user's mental model in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding around user pain points minimizes confusion and keeps users moving towards a goal. This user journey map shows how a person interacts with a brand or product over time and through different channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote the influence of empathy mapping here. At each stage in the journey, we should be aware of what the user thinks and feels and what motivates each action. The more you practice information design, the better you'll get at applying its principles to every asset you create as a designer. Whether you're communicating with users, teammates, or stakeholders, and whether you're designing body text, a set of data from a spreadsheet, or a diagram indicating a journey from start to finish, you'll want to make sure everything you design provides information, knowledge, and wisdom to your audience.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"balancing-user-needs-and-business-goals-|-earning-stakeholder-trust","title":" üé¨ Balancing User Needs and Business Goals | Earning Stakeholder Trust","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"10.3 BALANCING USER + BUSINESS GOALS Part 02\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765851893?h=151dd3cf11\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, let's talk about earning stakeholder trust. We'll start by defining a variety of stakeholder specializations. A Product Owner is an individual responsible for advocating for stakeholder needs and making sure decisions are made with an eye on maximizing business value. A Project Manager applies project management methodologies and tools to ensure projects deliver the expected results within scope, time, and budget. A Functional or Technical Lead provides input on behalf of the engineering team and assesses the technological feasibility of proposed ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Subject Matter Experts or SMEs are staff members who exhibit a high level of expertise in a specialized job, task, or skill. Before we go any farther, here's a scenario to imagine. You're in a room full of stakeholders, presenting data in an attempt to convince the team to make a drastic change to the product site map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the chances everyone is following along, understanding your motivations, and agreeing with you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is no matter how convincing your data, facts alone aren't persuasive. The relationships you build with people in that room will make them trust you and thus your facts. Work on the same team and bring everyone along on the journey. When investing in relationships with stakeholders, here are a few things to keep in mind. Lead with positivity. No one wants to just hear a long list of negatives about their product. Practice empathy. Understand stakeholder perspective, goals, and Key Performance Indicators. Understand where stakeholders are coming from before trying to convince them to change directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe honest and open about progress and leverage stakeholder help to remove blockers. Be proactive. A great product designer looks for opportunities and proposes improvements rather than just following orders. At the same time, here are a few things to avoid. Don't rely on facts alone. Don't be a know-it-all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvoid relying on complex terminology and techniques that make you sound impressive and intimidate your audience. Invite stakeholders into the conversation and ask questions to show you're interested in what they have to say. What's on your mind? How did you decide to take that approach? Why is this important to you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions like these are a great way to extend empathy and build trust. Now, here's a workshop scenario for you to practice. Your stakeholders have declared a business goal of limiting customer service requests by requiring users to filter through FAQs before viewing a customer service phone number or submitting a ticket. On the other hand, your users have a goal of contacting support as quickly as possible so they can get their problems solved. What can we design as a possible solution that meets both of these objectives? Pause the video and take 10 to 15 minutes to sketch out a few possible solutions on paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. How did you do? Let's discuss a sample solution. Pointing users to the right answer in a well-organized FAQ section solves both problems. Users get help faster and the business cuts down on support tickets. To do this, you might implement a system that quickly suggests a few common support answers based on category using either dropdowns or a suggestive search.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"information-design-|-information-design-as-a-task","title":" üé¨ Information Design | Information Design as a Task","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv style=\"padding: 62.5% 0 0 0; position: relative;\" title=\"embedded content\"\u003e\u003ciframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" title=\"11.1 INFORMATION DESIGN Part 03\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/765854963?h=ba1dba89fb\u0026amp;badge=0\u0026amp;autopause=0\u0026amp;player_id=0\u0026amp;app_id=58479\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranscript\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kinds of projects does an information designer work on, and how does an information designer know when to take action?

Online forms are notoriously difficult for users of all abilities to complete. Information designers help by breaking the form into discrete steps and minimizing, wherever possible, the number of fields users are required to fill out. Learning portals offer interactive online learning. Information\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edesigners can help organize and present information appropriate to what the user is trying to learn and for the user's current level of understanding. When designing annual reports, it's important to understand what leadership is looking to learn from the reports and what readers want to know about the health or expansion of the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for service blueprints, these are extensions of customer journey maps that align to a business goal, such as reducing redundancies or improving the employee experience. Finally, infographics are charts or diagrams used to reduce data complexity and share information visually. An information designer makes the complex simpler by removing unnecessary information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis often means embracing a progressive disclosure approach. Progressive disclosure sequences information and tasks across multiple screens. Start by placing the information most vital to your user in front of them.

In this series of lectures, we'll be discussing two topics: balancing user and business goals and feature prioritization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe content we'll be covering includes why designers need to speak the language of business, how to earn the trust of your stakeholders, and different methods for prioritizing product features. Let's begin with learning to speak business. The first term to discuss is tradeoffs. Designers need to be aware not only of business goals, but also of limitations such as time, budget, and technical capabilities. Tradeoffs happen when striking a balance between factoring in business goals and limitations and creating an optimal user experience. When deciding on tradeoffs, it often helps to create a two dimensional graph with increasing user value on the Y axis and decreasing effort by organization on the X axis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a proposed improvement or solution offers high user value and requires low effort to implement, teams should prioritize it. Keep in mind that while a product designer is a built-in advocate for the user, the user doesn't hire the product designer. The business does. You have an equal responsibility to address business objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny proposed improvement or solution should not only benefit the user, but also meet business goals. The term Product Sweet Spot can be used to describe situations where designers have considered three factors. The first is user needs. What makes the user's ability to complete tasks easier? What makes users feel confident, competent, and in control when using your product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is business needs. How will the business make or save money? How will the business gain new customers or keep existing ones? The third is technical constraints. Do we have sufficient time and budget to implement this feature? Do we have access to the right technology? A product designer who considers all three factors gains respect and earns their seat at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's consider a scenario that misses the Product Sweet Spot. Have you ever had trouble canceling a subscription? What was the product? Why was cancellation so difficult? Making it impossible to cancel a subscription is a dark pattern. It benefits the business financially in the short term, and it's probably not hard for developers to build. But doing so is damaging to the brand's image and shatters user trust. Now let's flip the scenario. What if you designed an interface where the cancel button was bold and the first thing users saw on their account page?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClicking it would cancel user subscriptions without any warning or any chance for the users to change their mind. While this would create a seamless experience for users, and would be easy for developers to implement, the business would likely suffer. Products sometimes need to keep users for a length of time to convince them of the value they provide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis scenario isn't thinking about the business or the cost of the design decision. Chances are, with metrics showing an uptick in cancellations and revenue going down, this designer would not be hired again. Your job is to create solutions that meet both user and business needs. Is the solution always black and white?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably not. You have a responsibility to advocate for the user that isn't in the room, but also for the business that hired you to make a better product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it's time for discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eApart from the cancellation flows we've already discussed, can you think of any features and products you've used that only solve business needs, but don't consider user needs?\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWhat about the reverse?

In the words of UX consultant Paul Boag, it is absolutely crucial to identify what core activities you want to support so that you have a clear picture of what lies outside of that core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, having a clear set of user and business goals identified will help you identify which features are most critical to achieving those goals. So what should we not be using to drive our feature prioritization decisions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shouldn't trust gut reactions. Sometimes people push an agenda because of a recent personal experience or a bit of negative feedback from an investor. While these arguments have a certain emotional appeal, feature prioritization should be backed up by data and user research. As for sales and support requests,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethese are the people on the front lines of your company. If they're hearing complaints, they'll tell you. However, don't forget there is a difference between what users say they want and what research demonstrates they actually need. How about the ROI or return on investment from a single feature? While a particular feature may promise more business revenue, more income doesn't always equal a better experience for your users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat characteristics are common to a positive feature prioritization experience? Transparency means everybody present should be able to see and understand how priorities are set. Consistency means sticking to a feature prioritization method quarter after quarter and not making arbitrary changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about fairness? Stakeholders might feel disappointed when their favorite feature isn't prioritized, but the disappointment is lessened when they perceive that the decision-making process is a fair one. Outcome orientation means we don't just prioritize features individually. Instead we view them holistically, searching for bundles of features that provide measurable value to the user and business. As for speed, it's always important to not only estimate how long a particular feature will take to implement and how much effort it requires from designers and developers, but also to communicate this clearly to stakeholders. Finally, keep all participants engaged by providing them a chance to offer feedback and stay involved and informed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's take a look at a few common feature prioritization methods used in the industry, including the Kano model, the Effort versus Impact matrix, the Eisenhower matrix, the MoSCoW method, and the WSJF method. The Kano model prioritizes features according to two competing criteria: their potential to satisfy customers and the investment needed to implement them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the strength of the Kano model is that it approaches feature prioritization from the user's perspective, it can be a bit complex to implement and for team members to understand. The Effort versus Impact Matrix can be a great way to think about the problems users face within your product. The x-axis on this two dimensional matrix is labeled Impact and refers to the value of solving a specific problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the problem isn't a major blocker for users or the solution doesn't offer much value, the impact will be minimal. The y-axis is labeled Effort and represents the amount of labor the solution will take and the feasibility of solving the problem. Former president Dwight Eisenhower is credited with creating a distinction between Important tasks that contribute to long term goals versus Urgent tasks that require immediate action and offer only short term benefits. When using the Eisenhower Matrix, if a task is both important and urgent, you should do it right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a task is important, but not urgent, you should schedule a time to handle it relatively soon. If a task is urgent, but not important, you should delegate it to someone else whenever possible. And if a task is neither urgent nor important, you should delete it from your list of todos. The letters M, S, C, and W in the name of the MoSCoW method\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estand for Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have. Features in the Must have quadrant of a Moscow matrix are non-negotiable product needs that are mandatory for the team to deliver. Features in the Should have quadrant can add significant value to the product, but are not vital to add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeatures in the Could have quadrant have less impact and are only nice to have. And features in the Won't have quadrant offer little value and could be postponed or eliminated from consideration. The WSJF method uses a math formula to determine an urgency score for each task. To calculate the urgency score, we add up the cost of delay and divide by the size of the job. The cost of delay is found by adding the user business value, the time criticality, and the risk reduction or opportunity enablement score. The user business value looks at how the feature impacts user and business goals. To determine the time criticality, ask yourself, is there a fixed deadline? Might we lose customers if this is not completed in a certain time? As for risk reduction or opportunity enablement, what is the risk if you delay implementing this feature? Will hurrying allow us to seize an opportunity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you've added these three scores and divided by the difficulty of delivering the feature, you have a WSJF priority score. The higher the score, the more important the task is to complete.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"the-jtbd-framework","title":"The JTBD framework","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003csection style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eJobs to be Done (JTBD) is a popular framework with product managers who use it to plan and execute roadmaps, often quarterly.
