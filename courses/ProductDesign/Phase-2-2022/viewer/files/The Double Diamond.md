# The Double Diamond
One of the most recognizable explanations of design is the Double Diamond, developed in 2004 by the [UK Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/who-we-are/our-mission). Specifically, it was developed to help non-designers understand the design process. Notably, it documents how designers were already working, not how they should work. There are thousands of variations of the model, which shows how useful it has been. IBM adapted the model to create their [infinity loop](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/loop).

The heart of the framework is exploring divergent possibilities (exploring widely and deeply) and eventual convergence (focused action) on a validated solution. The four quadrants–Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver–organize the design process into appropriate activities that support problem discovery and proposed solutions. 

The Design Council has recently extended the Double Diamond, to better represent the principles and methods that support the complexity of the design process. They acknowledge that there are many hidden activities in the design process that should be brought to the foreground because they have such an impact on the final solution. The updated framework represents the growing need for skills in leadership, storytelling, and relationships.
