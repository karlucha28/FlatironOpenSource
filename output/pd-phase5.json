Have you answered these questions for the hiring manager concisely and effectively with your case study and portfolio?</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Can the designer <strong>research</strong>?</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Can the designer <strong>synthesize</strong>?</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Can the designer <strong>deliver visually consistent deliverables</strong>?</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Can the designer <strong>show rationale for visual design decisions</strong>?</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Can the designer <strong>think, ideate, and problem solve</strong>?</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Can the designer <strong>validate with testing</strong>?</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Can the designer <strong>express all of the above in a concise, direct manner</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Context</h3>\n<p>Once you reach a later hiring stage, you might be asked to talk your way through a case study. However, consider the first impression your portfolio makes when a recruiter or HR person stumbles across it alone the first time.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Format</h3>\n<p>While a personal portfolio website is a common medium for delivering your design portfolio, additional options include <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://dribbble.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dribbble</a>, <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\">Behance</a>, slide decks, or creating a case study on a <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://medium.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a> blog.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n<h2>Shape your content</h2>\n<p>UX designers are sometimes in danger of telling too much in a case study because of the complexity of the design process. There may need to be some details consolidated or removed to make the story feel like it flows well to the reader. Remember, when in doubt, keep it simple and easy to digest. Shorter is always better.</p>\n<figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.chenkatherine.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://bucket.flatironopensource.ml//katherine-chen-portfolio.webp\" alt=\"Screenshot of Katherine Chen's web portfolio\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/4818/files/3311949\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Katherine Chen design portfolio.

If you did any concepting on branding, show the multiple ideas and visual directions you designed and why you landed on those concepts. Show adaptability in your visual design and user interaction skills and work. Lead with your visuals, but don\u2019t underestimate your supporting copy.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n<h2>Highlight your contribution</h2>\n<p>Your ability to work well and collaborate with others is key to your success in your next job. Anything you share about your journey should include key moments of teamwork while still highlighting your contribution to the particular project.</p>\n<p>Please don\u2019t be shy to give credit where it\u2019s due. For example, call out if another team member produced motion graphics for your video content. You can then mention that you managed the production of the video and helped with the storyboarding.</p>\n<figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.elizabethylin.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://bucket.flatironopensource.ml//elizabeth-lin-2.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of Elizabeth Lin's design portfolio\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/4818/files/3312623\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"></a>\n<figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Elizabeth Lin design portfolio.

Many offer drag and drop functionality as well as pre-designed templates in which to start from. This means designers can create a website without having to write a single line of code, although some website builders offer the ability to update the code by hand if you\u2019re comfortable doing so.</p>\n<p>Website builders frequently provide web hosting. For example, all Squarespace plans include hosting for your site as well as unlimited file storage and unlimited bandwidth (a term meaning the maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.)</p>\n<p>Below are a few popular examples of website builders.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Squarespace</h3>\n<p><a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace</a> comes with a 14-day trial, but requires a monthly subscription once the trial expires.

This means student assignments, freelance work, and self-initiated projects taken on to thoughtfully practice and demonstrate your skills.</p>\n<p>When starting out in the industry, it\u2019s acceptable to describe the design projects you completed as a student on your resume. After all, those projects faced many of the same concerns as real-world design projects, and were taken through a similar design process.</p>\n<p>However, in her article <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/how-to-create-a-ux-portfolio-without-ux-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">How to create a UX portfolio without UX experience</a>, author Sarah Doody cautions against stopping there.

Your resume and portfolio site are ready, but if you really want to maximize your chances of success, you will want to go further into your preparation.</p>\n<p>As a Designer, you are never expected to be great at everything, but in an interview you want to be prepared to discuss anything. The hiring process is competitive, so it's important to stand out from the rest.

These can be broken down into the following categories:</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Situational</h3>\n    <p>Situational interview questions are focused on how you would perform under certain circumstances while in your position as a product designer. They are similar in nature to behavioral questions.</p>\n    <p>Situational questions are meant to give your interviewer a feel for your on-the-job problem solving, along with the types of situations you anticipate. It's during these questions that you can provide past examples of exemplary work in your previous positions.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Design Challenges</h3>\n    <p>Design challenges are often structured in a similar way. With these types of questions, you will be asked to pitch a product design based on some set of parameters given to you by the interviewer.</p>\n  \n   <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://bucket.flatironopensource.ml//ux-design-challenge-whiteboard-exercise.webp\" alt=\"Two designers working at a whiteboard\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.uxbeginner.com/how-to-prepare-ux-interview-design-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">How to prepare for UX interview design challenges</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  \n    <p>Some employers may even ask you to redesign something of theirs or some other famous product. All in all, the design challenge portion of your interview may be the most important for getting the job offer.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">App/Product Critiques</h3>\n    <p>App or Product Critiques are a bit more focused on your design philosophy and style. Your interviewer may ask more open-ended questions about an app or product of your choosing. Questions may range from what product designs you admire to pointing out major design flaws in an established product. The most common, of course, is about your favorite product.</p>\n    <p>You should come to the interview with some products already in mind.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Sample interview questions</h2>\n    <p>We created a list of 8 product design interview questions, including questions from real companies, so you can nail your soon-to-come technical interviews.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Design Heroes</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cWho are your design heroes? What are your favorite apps?\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>Listening to the reasons why you love your design heroes and favorite apps can reveal a great deal about your everyday approach to product design. It sheds light on your \u201cdesign thinking\u201d sensibility and your bar for quality, and speaks volumes about what kind of product designer you are.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Design Thinking</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cWhat does the term \u2018design thinking\u2019 mean to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>The term \u201cdesign thinking\u201d is often synonymous with human-centered design (HCD). The interview listens for you to describe \u201cdesign thinking\u201d as a user-centered design process. Most of all, it\u2019s a \u201cpeople-first\u201d approach\u2014a design process mindset that designs products around people\u2019s needs, motivations, and behaviors.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Users with Disabilities</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cWhat is your approach to making websites and platforms accessible to all user groups, including users with visual, hearing, and motor disabilities?\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>The interviewer intentionally takes notice of how aware you are and if you follow the World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s \u201dWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines.\u201d Have you performed an accessibility analysis on a previous project?</p>\n    <p>Some examples of using accessibility could include using voiceover commands to navigate websites and apps for people with motor disabilities, adding captions to a video, which benefits people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, making content easier to read by screen readers for the blind, or designing an option to use large typography for users with vision impairment.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Design Process</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cDescribe your product design process and what methods you follow.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>In general, good product designers will walk through a specific process (or \u201ctoolkit\u201d) they follow when approaching a problem or project. It will likely be a set of steps they take to solve user problems and create engaging product experiences. The interviewer listens for a clear process and a goal to align with their company's needs and values, a deep curiosity and a constant desire to learn, and the specific steps you would take to solve user problems.</p>\n    <p>Key concepts or methods used to carry out this process may include but are not limited to: competitive audits, stakeholder interviews, user personas, empathy maps, user research, content audits, minimum viable product (MVP) and Lean UX, information architecture, business model canvases, mood boards, storyboards, use case scenarios and user flows, customer journeys, wireframes, mockups, prototypes, and usability testing.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">A Great Designer</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cWhat does it mean to be a great product designer?\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>This answer helps the hiring manager know the type of product designer they are considering. While there is no right or wrong answer, a good product designer should have extensive knowledge about the product design process and possess a \u201cdesign mindset.\u201d A great product designer would talk about what a \u201cdesign mindset\u201d means, a comprehensive, holistic, end-to-end product design process, approaches, and methodologies. You should be willing to walk step-by-step through an ideal product design approach you consider essential to excellent product design and that guides your work toward robust working solutions.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">The interviewer listens for humility backed by confidence.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">The interviewer listens for answers that include a discussion around empathy</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Design Trends</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cWhat are some of the biggest trends in the product design field?\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>A product designer who thinks ahead will be an invaluable asset to the company. The interviewer may want you to discuss new use cases beyond screens\u2014or how designing for accessibility is an area of interest for you. In this question, you can discuss new prototyping tools that save developers and designers time by converting the design to code, or may explain an evolving trend and how terrific it is to be at the forefront of technology.</p>\n    <p>Whatever the answer, let your passion should shine through. In this question, it\u2019s not about technology, it\u2019s about solving problems for people in new and efficient ways.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Product Design Example</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cWalk me through a product design example where you set out to solve a business problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>Using a case study, a great product designer would demonstrate their understanding of the difference between designing an interface, a website, or an app, and also a way to solve a business problem. It's best to talk about the discovery/problem definition phase, where you carry out comprehensive research to uncover insights into the source of the problem.</p>\n    <p>Next, keeping business goals in mind, you would research users from the target demographic and identified common themes, unmet user needs, and where the business may have fallen short in serving that demographic. You would demonstrate your skill at evaluating the goals of the company, the use case scenarios, and how to best align them to find a solution.</p>\n    <p>Lastly, you could reach into your product design toolkit and wireframes and prototypes (among other things) to explore potential product design solutions. Through user testing, you could have validate ideas and hypotheses focused on obtaining significant business values from the solutions achieved by optimal product design.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Product Design Project</h3>\n    <blockquote>\u201cDescribe a recent product design project you were particularly challenged by and how you approached the problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n    <p>Product designers thrive on solving challenges, so a good candidate would readily share enthusiasm about how they approach problems. This question helps the interviewers understand more about your process. What did you find challenging, and why? How did you set out to come up with a solution?</p>\n    <p>While there is no right or wrong way to approach a particular challenge, having a clear strategy to facilitate an end goal is essential.</p>\n</section>"

Companies will often leverage design challenges to provide opportunities for skill-building and team building. It\u2019s also common for design professionals to leverage them to sharpen their skills or add to their portfolios. But design challenges are probably most frequently encountered in design interviews.</p>\n    <p>Tech companies have slightly different approaches to interviewing for Product Designer positions. But all of them aim to check candidate\u2019s product thinking. Design challenges are a way to get signal on skills that aren\u2019t always evident in a portfolio: problem solving strategy, product thinking and scope analysis, communication, collaboration, prioritization.</p>\n    <p>Design challenges are an opportunity to more authentically share and reflect on your problem solving process. You can explore the problem however you want, and the solution doesn\u2019t have to be perfect or ideal because you\u2019re not expected to get it right anyway, your solution isn\u2019t going to get built.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Types of design challenges</h2>\n    <p>Design challenges vary in length and scope. Some will be one hour, others can last a week. Some will be directly related to the company\u2019s business or current projects. Others will be random or creatively unusual, and encourage you to generate out-of-the-box solutions.</p>\n    <p>Design challenges usually fall into two categories.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Whiteboard challenges</h3>\n    <p>Whiteboard challenges are exercises that happen live, in the room with people from that company, with roughly executed deliverables thought out on the spot. You\u2019ll often be asked to talk out loud while you sketch out your thoughts and ideas.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://bucket.flatironopensource.ml//Whiteboard_Challenge_hero.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a whiteboard challenge\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/4818/files/3376009\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://dscout.com/people-nerds/whiteboard-challenge-ux-research-interview-tips\" target=\"_blank\">How to Ace the Dreaded Whiteboard Challenge</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>For remote interviews, an \u201consite\u201d challenge might happen over a remote collaboration tool, such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://miro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Miro</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://mural.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Mural</a>.

Depending on the company, prompts will drastically vary in format, timeframe, and complexity.</p>\n    <p>While still very much about getting a sense of your design approach, take-home challenges are often leveraged to assess technical capability. For example, you might receive an assignment that requires the use of specific software or tools or that asks for a specific outcome, such as a prototype.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>How to approach a design challenge</h2>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">1. Understand the task</h3>\n    <p>Before you do anything, you\u2019ll need to get alignment and agreement on the task. If you have any questions about the challenge, ask questions before doing anything else. One question area you to get clarity on is the <strong>expected outcome</strong> of the challenge itself.</p>\n    <p><strong>Pro Tip: Write down the agreed upon outcome in big letters so you can be reminded of it throughout the exercise.</strong></p>\n    <p>Typically, for design challenges, you\u2019ll have access to writing tools like sticky notes and paper or a whiteboard. You can create a bullet list of expectations and a high-level or stages for the challenge: define, understand, brainstorm, iterate and test, reflect.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">2. Identify everything you know</h3>\n    <p>When you first begin working on a design challenge, consider everything you can be fairly certain about and everything you don\u2019t know but might be able to find an answer to during the challenge. Write everything asked and answered down. Make drawings if it helps.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://bucket.flatironopensource.ml//Whiteboard_challenge.png\" alt=\"\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/4818/files/3499387\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/preparing-for-the-whiteboard-design-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">How to Prepare for the Whiteboard Design Challenge: A Guide</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>Half the time you spend on the challenge should be asking questions, writing down assumptions, and aligning on definitions/goals with the other person in the room.

Repeat until you begin to formulate a more realistic vision of a possible solution.</p>\n    <p>Bring in the interviewer, if they are playing a collaborative role. Make the activity into a brainstorm and <strong>utilize the interviewer</strong> for feedback, for coming up with ideas, or for flagging things you might have missed (it\u2019s totally ok to say: \u201cWhat am I overlooking?\u201d and \u201cDoes this feel like a good direction to you?\u201d).</p>\n    <p>Remember to always tie what you\u2019re doing back to the expected outcome of the challenge and the problem being solved.</p>\n    <p>If you\u2019re drawing something on the board, explain why. If you\u2019re going to ignore a potential problem or drawback to a solution, state as much (you don\u2019t even need to explain why, this is all make-believe anyway and the goal is to progress toward solving a problem). Talk about your thinking, where you\u2019re getting stuck, how you want to proceed. When in doubt, ask if you\u2019re providing enough detail or if you need to be more transparent.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">4. Reflect on the challenge</h3>\n    <p>Allow a few spare minutes to take time to reflect out loud. Interviewers want to see self-awareness and reflection, as both are important traits of a good problem solver.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n  <h2>Things to remember</h2>\n  <p>The design challenge is a highly condensed format of the day-to-day work you might do as a product designer, so nobody expects you to come up with an ideal solution.</p>\n  <p>The challenges you encounter are designed to be bigger than what you\u2019re able to accomplish in the given time.

Here\u2019s why</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  \n\n    <p>Another common criticism is whether design challenges are even a helpful form of assessment. This critique poses that while design challenges require a significant amount of additional work, they don\u2019t usually provide any insight that wouldn\u2019t be gained from a portfolio review and/or discussion of work.</p>\n    <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n        <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Design challenges are borderline unethical.<br><br>We definitely should judge organizations that require them as being places we recommend professionals not consider applying to.<br><br>Companies post jobs should have to state whether they\u2019ll require a candidate to do a design challenge.</p>\n        \u2014 Jared Spool (@jmspool) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1320919000000417792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2020</a>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Take-home challenges potentially introduce a lot of unfair advantages and disadvantages depending on a candidate\u2019s situation. For example, a lengthy challenge might be doable for an unemployed recent graduate, but what about a single parent who already has a full-time job?</p>\n    <p>If a design challenge seems excessively demanding of your time, it\u2019s worth reassessing whether this is still a place you\u2019d like to work.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Assessing design challenges</h2>\n    <p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when you encounter a design challenge while interviewing with a company.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Your time and talent are valuable.</h3>\n    <p>Remember, you deserve to get paid fairly for your work.</p>\n    <p>Some companies offer to compensate designers for take-home challenges. If you\u2019re asked to do unpaid work, consider whether the time and effort you\u2019re putting in is worth it to you.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Make sure you\u2019ve invested before committing.</h3>\n    <p>Since design challenges are a significant time investment, they\u2019re often reserved for later stages of the interview process when the company and candidate have gotten to know each other. If you\u2019re asked to do a design challenge in early stages, you might first ask for an informational interview so that you can get a better idea of the role and expectations before committing to the challenge.</p>\n    <h3 style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">You shouldn\u2019t be solving a current business problem.</h3>\n    <blockquote>\n        <p>\u201cAfter a very enjoyable initial call where I had a great rapport with the interviewer, she explained that the next round of interviews was a design exercise: I was to redesign a section of their existing product.
