Modules can hold several types of content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Page:</strong> a page of content to read</li>\n<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> a course discussion in which teachers and students can actively participate</li>\n<li><strong>Quiz:</strong> A course quiz, generally multiple choice questions or true/false questions</li>\n<li><strong>Assignment:</strong> A course assignment. Assignments are graded projects that count toward your final score</li>\n<li><strong>Link or External Tool:</strong> an external link or tool to view information outside of the course</li>\n<li><strong>File:</strong> a file to download or view</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may be required to perform certain actions to complete a module. Requirements may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>View:</strong> You must view the item.</li>\n<li><strong>Mark as done:</strong> You must mark the module item as done before progressing to the next item.</li>\n<li><strong>Contribute:</strong> You must post a reply to the discussion topic or contribute content to a page.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit:</strong> You must submit the assignment, graded discussion, or quiz.</li>\n<li><strong>Score at least X points:</strong> You must submit the assignment with a minimum of the shown score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the 'Modules' button on the sidebar on the left-hand side within each course.</p>\n<h2 className=\"text-2xl\">ASSIGNMENTS</h2>\n<p>While the module controls the flow of the entire course, you can also access a running list of your course assignments via the 'Assignments' button on your Sidebar on the left-hand side within the course.</p>\n<p>By default, assignments are grouped by overdue assignments, upcoming assignments, undated assignments, and past assignments.</p>\n<p>Each assignment includes an icon designating an assignment, discussion, or quiz and will also display availability dates, due dates, and the number of points the assignment is worth.</p>\n<p>You can find the 'Assignments' button on the sidebar on the left-hand side within each course.</p>"

The survey includes insights from over 4000 design practitioners from around the world to see how industry tools change from year to year. You can read through the survey to identify other tools to experiment within your design practice, but this course has elected to primarily use Figma, Invision, and Webflow as the foundations for production work in all phases.</p>\n<p>These tools are robust and serve the needs of UX and UI professionals to create low-fidelity mockups, high-fidelity mockups, and clickable prototypes for testing. In this prework course, we will get you set up with these tools and give you a brief walkthrough of the core features you'll need for Design Labs. We will not take a deep dive into all the features of these tools in the prework. Your instructors in the main coursework will walk you through special case scenarios and additional features to speed up workflows.</p>\n<p>Continue on to get set up with Figma and practice some basic layout and prototyping features.</p>"

You are free to use those ideas or to develop your own.</li>\n<li>This is your first time jumping into the Product Design process. I know that it can be intimidating to be asked to create solutions to complex problems. Remember, this is mostly a thought exercise. <strong>There are no wrong answers!&nbsp;</strong>You should try your best to be creative and to look for problems that resonate with you in the case studies.</li>\n<li>Try to develop two completely different solutions to different problems. For instance, if your first problem solves the issue of access to credit, your second solution should solve a different problem.</li>\n<li>This project is intentionally open-ended. You are not required to follow any best practices in terms of processes or deliverables. You are free to work with a pen and paper, or with Google docs, or with any other documentation method that is accessible to you.</li>\n<li>Have fun! This is your first dive into an incredible career, so make the most of it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 className=\"text-3xl\">Project Requirements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Read through the research of food production in emerging markets<br></strong>Make sure you read through part one of the paper because it represents the bulk of the overall research and outlines the diagrams of traditional agricultural economies and the emerging economies that include industrialization. The problems studied are outlined in part one as well as methodology. It's a good example of excellent research.<br>Also, be sure to find case studies that resonate with and inspire you to find solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify problems to solve<br></strong>After you've read through the research, document the problems that you want to solve. You don't have to be extremely specific, but you should indicate three things: The cause of the problems, the persons impacted by the problem, and any existing solutions to the problem</li>\n<li><strong>Ideate possible solutions to the problems<br></strong>Try not to be critical of your ideas. It can be hard to trust your instincts. List out as many ideas as you can think of. Think about what technologies you could use (Phones, tablets, computers) and how you would implement a solution. Who else would be involved? What would it cost? What kind of training would the rural populations require? Be creative. The sky is the limit, but be sure to indicate solutions to both problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce your list of ideas to just the best solutions</strong><br>Even if you developed a hundred ideas in step 3, you can only implement one solution for each problem. Now is the time to be critical and cut out ideas that are impractical or might require more effort than they are worth. Find the best solution to each of your problems and start a document for each problem that explains why your solution makes sense.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a project plan<br></strong>In the final step of this process, you will elaborate on each of your problem docs to indicate all of the considerations of a Product Designer. The following list isn't intended to be exhaustive. Try to think about all of the hurdles that you might face while developing your product.<br>Consider the following questions:\n<ol>\n<li>What further research is needed?</li>\n<li>What kind of prototype might make sense?</li>\n<li>Should you consult with other specialists?</li>\n<li>How will you conduct testing?</li>\n<li>What other hurdles might there be to success?</li>\n<li>Once the product is launched, how will you maintain it?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Keep your product ideas. After you've completed the Flatiron Product Design program, you can look back at this project and reevaluate your choices. It will be a good indicator of how far you've come in just a few months.</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
