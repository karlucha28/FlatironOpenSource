And while it\u2019s easy to get wrapped up in the excitement of new projects, you shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the impact that design can have on people, cultures, and the environment. Many design practices (like behavioral design, persuasive design, and habit design) rely on targeting people\u2019s emotions, behaviors, and motivations, which leaves a lot of ambiguity in ethical boundaries. Add to this ambiguity the daily emerging technologies (artificial intelligence, mass data collection, advanced algorithms, connected devices, robotics, etc.) that are reshaping human values, ethics, and privacy infringement issues.</p>\n<p>As technologies and design practices continue to grow, designers can expect to find themselves at an ethical crossroads. Now, more than ever, designers need to develop their sense of design ethics and values to bring to the table.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n<h2>Designers have an obligation to responsible design</h2>\n<p>Ethics, or moral philosophy, has long been theorized, studied, and debated throughout recorded history, beginning with the Greek philosophers. According to<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic\" target=\"_blank\">Merriam Webster</a>, ethics is \u201cthe discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation.\u201d Ethics stands apart from other fields of study because it isn\u2019t rooted in factual knowledge or data: What might be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d for one person may be entirely different for another. It\u2019s challenging to create a set of ethical standards that defines \u201cunethical\u201d versus \u201cethical.\u201d</p>\n<p>Design ethics is explicitly associated with the sense of moral duty and obligation designers have to create responsible designs.<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://uxpamagazine.org/building-an-ethics-framework-for-ux-design/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Kiess</a><span>&nbsp;</span>identifies three categories of design ethics.</p>\n<h3>Existential values</h3>\n<p>Designers reflect on their values to discern what companies they work at and what products, services, and experiences they design. They might consider their own political, religious, or moral views.</p>\n<h3>Misdirected intent</h3>\n<p>Designers prioritize other goals and needs, most often business goals, above the users\u2019 needs. An example of this is when Uber charges more during peak hours due to high demand rather than staffing more drivers during those hours.</p>\n<h3>Benevolent intent</h3>\n<p>Designers put the user and their needs at the forefront of all design decisions while taking a pragmatic approach to product development and business needs. For example, a company displays benevolent intent when allowing users to test a product to ensure it fits their needs before purchasing it.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n<h2>A Designer\u2019s Code of Ethics, by Mike Monteiro</h2>\n<p>Mike Monteiro, co-founder and design director of<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://muledesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mule Design</a>, an interactive design studio, outlined<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://deardesignstudent.com/a-designers-code-of-ethics-f4a88aca9e95\" target=\"_blank\">A Designer\u2019s Code of Ethics</a>, often referenced as an ethical standard throughout the design field.

However, you\u2019ll notice that this doesn\u2019t always happen. Older products/services might not have been designed according to more modern accessibility standards, and newer products/services may have been designed by a team/company who viewed accessibility as a legal hurdle that ate up time, money, and resources.</p>\n    <p>In your career, you\u2019ll likely be asked to run an accessibility audit on an older, existing product created without accessibility in mind. You\u2019ll also be asked to do the same for the designs you make to validate for your boss, stakeholders, or the client that the product is, indeed, accessible. (It\u2019s also not a bad idea to do an accessibility audit of your company/client\u2019s existing digital products regardless of if you are asked to or not.)</p>\n    <p>An <strong>accessibility audit</strong> aims to define which elements of the website or digital product/service are accessible and which elements need to be modified and improved. It allows designers to validate that every user will be able to accomplish their goals quickly and equally. A thorough accessibility audit includes:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Designer observations</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">The results of various accessibility tests</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">A rundown of how closely the product/service adheres to governing accessibility guidelines</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>At the end of the audit, you can highlight accessibility weaknesses and offer areas for improvement.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/accessibility-audit.png\" alt=\"Accessibility audit dashboard.\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5472/files/2908481\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-an-accessibility-audit/\" target=\"_blank\">What to look for in an accessibility audit</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>Your audit should include the results of standardized accessibility tests you need to run on the product/service. These tests will give teams and stakeholders a set of qualitative and quantitative data to work off of in improving accessibility. Fortunately, you have a ton of tools at your disposal to quickly and accurately run accessibility tests. These tools automate the process, saving you a ton of manual time.</p>\n    <p>Tools that automate the accessibility evaluation process are software programs or online services that help designers determine if digital content meets accessibility standards. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has compiled a <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive list</a> of these tools, which you can filter through to find the ones most relevant to the particular product or service you are evaluating. There is no golden number of tests you should run before you consider your audit complete. Aim to run as many as are relevant until you have a wide range of global and feature-specific data that you can use to advocate for improvements to the product/service\u2019s accessibility.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n    <h2>Conducting an Audit</h2>\n    <p>To conduct an<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/\" target=\"_blank\">accessibility audit</a>, commit to challenging all assumptions around who will and won\u2019t use the product/service. You might have an idea of who the intended audience is, but you never truly know all of the people that might use your product/service to complete a daily, monthly, yearly or one-time task or goal.</p>\n    <p>As you navigate through the product/service, the goal is to find opportunities to improve the design\u2019s accessibility to better support various disabilities and user limitations. When designing to reach <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\" target=\"_blank\">Level AA conformance</a>, one of the more popular levels of compliance, be sure to speak to the following:</p>\n    <h3>User Tasks and Navigation</h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Pattern libraries:</strong> Use pattern libraries to define a coherent and consistent system for users. After you establish your baseline hierarchy and pattern usage, avoid deviating from them, so your audience\u2019s navigation is not hindered. Switching design patterns around on your users drives down usability and causes user dropoff.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Forms:</strong> Everyone (especially those with cognitive disabilities) benefits from a logical, clear, and intuitive form. Accessible forms refer to ensuring they are allowed for people who use screen readers or keyboards to navigate easily through tasks. Start with making sure the form can be completed by someone who only uses the keyboard to navigate. Provide clear guidance and information within the form, and be sure to associate form labels with controls</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Time-based tasks:</strong> Some people require more time than others to complete specific tasks. A person with a motor function disability or poor vision will likely need a few extra seconds or minutes to understand and finish a digital task (like a form) than someone with perfect vision and fast typing skills. If security concerns necessitate a time limit for users, the first step in promoting accessibility is to make sure users are warned about that time limit well in advance. You can also allow users to turn off, adjust or extend the time limit before encountering it.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>CAPTCHA:</strong> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CAPTCHA\" target=\"_blank\">CAPTCHA</a> is a way companies verify if a user is a human versus a robot. You\u2019ve probably encountered this before when you\u2019ve been asked to fill out a digital form or log in to an interface. It asks users to complete a task believed to be relatively simple for humans but difficult for robots. However, some of these \u201csimple\u201d tasks are not so easy for those with disabilities and other impairments. It\u2019s best to have a CAPTCHA that combines vision-based, audio-based, and biometrics-based tasks to make it more accessible to users who cannot complete tasks based on only one type.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Open-tab links:</strong> If there\u2019s a link that a user can open from your interface or website, make sure it doesn\u2019t open in a new window or tab. Links that open in new windows or tabs aren\u2019t accessible to users navigating via a screen-reader and users with cognitive impairments.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Keyboard-compatible tasks:</strong> Some users navigate the web solely via keyboard, rather than with a mouse or trackpad (due to disability, impairment, convenience, or just personal preference). Ensure all the content, navigation commands, and tasks can be found or reached using a keyboard. This often means that a user uses the tab button to navigate around the platform, so creating a logical tab order is critical to making sure the site is accessible. Additionally, adding a \u201cskip to content\u201d header before the page header also helps keyboard users navigate the content without the need to tab through half of the page. Ultimately, the goal is for users to engage with the right content with the fewest amount of keystrokes.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/prototyping-keyboard-triggers-accessibility-1257x550.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration demonstrating keyboard shortcuts\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5472/files/2908497\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/best-practices-for-prototyping-keyboard-accessibility/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Practices for Prototyping Keyboard Accessibility</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>Interaction Design Elements</h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Interactions:</strong> Be mindful of how often you use interactions on the platform. Users should understand the design of the platform and the tasks that need to be completed without relying solely on the interactions. Since users can complete tasks without interactions, things like hover states may only distract users -- especially those with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Animations:</strong> Animations are great for bringing designs to life, but your designs shouldn\u2019t rely on them to communicate pertinent information to users. Another thing to keep in mind is: Animated designs that flash will make your platform inaccessible (and potentially super harmful) to users with epilepsy or other seizure-causing impairments. Be sure that your animated designs don\u2019t flash more than 3 times per second, regardless of size and contrast.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Pointer gestures:</strong> The more complicated the pointer gestures, the less accessible the platform. Much like device motion, leave the option open for users to deactivate these features when necessary. Additionally, provide single-pointer alternatives: Those who cannot pinch, drag, and gesture still need to access your platform and perform essential tasks.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Touch targets:</strong> Touch targets or anything on a phone or tablet that the user needs to touch to perform a task needs to be at least 9mm high by 9mm wide, regardless of the device. Be sure to include inactive space in between touchpoints to de-risk the user clicking on something by mistake.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Alternative device motion:</strong> Build in features that allow the user to deactivate/activate motions to suit their specific needs better. Not everyone will be able to gesture swipe for Tinder or tilt their phones for Google Maps. While these are excellent features that have become colloquialized and ingrained in popular culture, they\u2019re not accessible to every user. Build products with the understanding that motion-based features should be able to be disabled when needed.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Visual Design Elements</h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Data visualizations:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If data visualizations (graphs, infographics, charts, etc.) are not carefully thought about from an accessibility standpoint, it will be harder for some users to understand the information they are supposed to take away from those visualizations. You want everyone to be able to interpret your visualizations in a way that gives them the info you want to convey, so make sure you\u2019re careful about using color-agnostic coding, clear text, alternative text, white space, distinctive labeling and takeaway titles to give users multiple ways of identifying the \u201cpoint\u201d of your visuals.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Audio and video:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Provide transcripts and captions for audio or video elements to make them accessible to hearing-impaired users. Use audio and video only as necessary and make sure that there is no pertinent information in audio or video attachments.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Typography:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Typography should be legible with line spacing minimally 1.5 times the font size in a paragraph and two times the font size following a paragraph section. The typeface in use should have tracking 0.12 times and kerning at least 0.16 times the font size. All large-scale text (header and subheaders) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Color:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>color should have contrast at least<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\" target=\"_blank\">4.5:1</a><span>&nbsp;</span>against its background.

It\u2019s easy to fall back on color to build CTAs and to drive user understanding, but keep in mind that those understandings will be totally lost on users who are color impaired. Instead, focus on promoting user understanding by using precise language to define your call-to-action.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Headers:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Promote clarity by using understandable language in your headers. This may sound pretty straightforward, but headlines can quickly turn into click-bait or marketing fodder that is unrelated to the supporting content. Keep headlines simple and relevant to the content underneath them.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Content orientation:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Think about how your designs can stack content to both portrait and landscape viewpoints.

Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest are examples of products that users get used to and keep them coming back. Better yet, they become a part of their day-to-day and integrate into their lives vs. disrupt them.</p>\n    <p>High-growth or high-engagement, on their own, are not enough to make a successful product. Businesses need to master behavior design to keep users engaged long enough to form new habits. However, consider what habits you are trying to change with your product or service and what benefit this provides the user.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Things to consider</h2>\n    <h3>New behaviors must be pleasurable, not forced.</h3>\n    <p>To encourage the behavior to become a habit, think about your product or service and ask yourself if you are helping users do something they want to do for the pleasure of it? How might you inject more fun into your design?</p>\n    <h3>Distinguish between frequent and infrequent habits.</h3>\n    <p>Ask if your company or business depends on users coming back on their own, or can you use other methods to drive engagement? Think about whether your business model necessitates forming habits? If your product isn't used frequently (at least once a week), it won't become a habit. All products cannot convert usage into habits.</p>\n    <h3>Increase customer engagement with content and community.</h3>\n    <p>When you cannot bring users back to your core product, you can often \"attach\" a habit to your product. Blogs and social communities ensure readers and commentors keep coming back and keep the brand in mind. The focus should be to provide compelling content for the user without forcing the action you want them to take.</p>\n    <p>Williams-Sonoma, the high-end cookware company, was struggling to get repeat customers. The team didn't know how to create a habit of buying high-end cookware.

Embrace the TL;DR (Too Long; Didn\u2019t Read) model and provide a summary of a web page\u2019s content early to help users identify whether this page is meaningful to them.</p>\n    <h3>Provide healthy default settings</h3>\n    <p>Limiting screen time is a healthy goal, provided users are able to distinguish between intentional and unintentional screen time. Interrupting activities with reminders of accumulated screen time can cause user anxiety.</p>\n    <p>While gently reminding users of approaching screen time limits can be useful, avoiding addictive patterns such as video autoplay and infinite scroll increases user control over their screen time habits.</p>\n    <h3>Introduce friction</h3>\n    <p>While tech companies often prioritize a seamless experience, using technology mindlessly leads to unhealthy habits. Think about composing or sharing a tweet on Twitter: the experience takes only seconds, but is that always a good thing?

Creating intrigue upon taking action by changing up the reward is what users start craving. When the brain is expecting a reward, there is a feel-good <strong>dopamine</strong> surge. Making the reward variable multiplies the effect.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Phase 4: Investment.</strong> The more time, data, effort, social capital, or money the user puts into the product keeps them coming back for more. This investment increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the hook cycle. By cycling through successive hooks, users begin to form associations with internal triggers, which attach to existing behaviors and emotions and become habits.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>An example of the Hook Model in action:</p>\n    <ol>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Barbra sees a photo in her Facebook newsfeed taken by a family member from a rural part of the state. It's a lovely picture, and since she is planning a trip there with her brother Johnny, the external trigger's call-to-action intrigues her, and she clicks. Over time, Barbra associates Facebook with her need for social connection.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">The simple action of clicking on the interesting picture in her newsfeed takes Barbra to Pinterest, a \"pinboard-style photo-sharing\" site. Once Barbra completes the simple action of clicking on the photo, she is dazzled by what she sees next.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">The images are related to what she is generally interested in \u2014 but other things catch her eye as well. The exciting juxtaposition of relevant and irrelevant, tantalizing and plain, beautiful and familiar, sets her brain's dopamine system aflutter with the promise of reward. Before she knows it, she's spent 45 minutes scrolling.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">She slowly builds a desire to keep the things that delight her. By collecting items, she'll be giving the site data about her preferences. Soon she will follow, pin, re-pin, and make other investments, which will increase her ties to the site and prime her for future loops through the hook.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <h3>Critique of the hook model</h3>\n    <p>Not everyone is thrilled with the idea of building habit-forming products, however.

When you need to make decisions, there is always a research methodology to help you.</p>\n    <blockquote>User research helps us to understand how other people live their lives, so that we can respond more effectively to their needs with informed and inspired design solutions. User research also helps us to avoid our own biases, because we frequently have to create design solutions for people who aren\u2019t like us. \u2013<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/5-step-process-conducting-user-research/\" target=\"_blank\">David Sherwin</a></blockquote>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>An Array of Methodologies</h2>\n    <p>In the context of a project, each research type has many different methods you can use. Through this program, you will learn which one is appropriate to adopt and when. The research questions you have will determine the best approach, which is why it\u2019s essential to be thoughtful and exact when writing them.</p>\n    <h3>Primary vs. Secondary Research</h3>\n    <p>Primary research refers to new research data, also known as \u201craw data\u201d, that you collect yourself, rather than depending on existing data from previously conducted research. It involves gathering data directly from the source, typically through user interviews, user groups, contextual inquiry, surveys, etc.</p>\n    <p>Secondary research refers to leveraging existing data that has already been gathered, synthesized, and published by others. It relies on existing primary research published on the internet or printed articles, reports, books, trade journals, and other publications.</p>\n    <h3>Exploratory vs. Evaluative Research</h3>\n    <p>Exploratory research, also known as generative research, aims to understand user needs and desires and ultimately influence problem framing, ideation, and concept development within a project. It\u2019s often leveraged in the discovery phase when developing a brand new product or when an existing product is undergoing a design pivot or improvements. Because generative research focuses mainly on gathering user insights, there\u2019s a lot of overlap with primary research methods such as user interviews, user groups, surveys, etc.</p>\n    <p>Evaluative research aims to assess or judge something that exists: this might be a specific problem, solution, concept, or something more tangible like a sketch, mockup, or prototype. The assessment aims to make sure solutions are rooted in the user\u2019s needs and desires.</p>\n    <p>There are two main types of evaluative studies:</p>\n    <p><strong>Formative evaluation</strong> focuses on assessing and strengthening a design, such as a current state or concept, early on in the product development cycle. It\u2019s often used to identify pain points and other problems that a team must address as development continues. An excellent example of a formative evaluation method is concept testing.</p>\n    <p><strong>Summative evaluation</strong> focuses on assessing the outcome or effects of something rather than the process. It often occurs in the later stages of the product development cycle when a final or near-final design exists. An excellent example of a summative evaluation method is usability testing.</p>\n    <h3>Attitudinal vs. Behavioral Research</h3>\n    <p>Attitudinal research focuses on gathering user insights based on what people say. It can result in skewed or biased data if participants lack self-awareness in certain areas, feel self-conscious, or are influenced by those around them, also known as \u201cherd behavior\u201d. Examples include user interviews, focus groups, and surveys.</p>\n    <p>Behavioral research focuses on gathering user insights by observing people\u2019s actions and behaviors. It often allows for a greater understanding of user needs and desires that may occur at a subconscious cognitive level. Examples include contextual inquiry, ethnographic observation, usability testing, and field studies.</p>\n    <h3>Quantitative vs. Qualitative Research</h3>\n    <p><strong>Quantitative research</strong> <span>&nbsp;</span>is studying numbers. It leverages statistics and percentages, such as surveys, polls, and rating scales, and is particularly useful during decision-making and evaluation. When you need to know the scale of something\u2013how big, how long, or how many\u2013then you need quant-driven methods.</p>\n    <p><strong>Qualitative research</strong> <span>&nbsp;</span>is about studying qualities. It leverages research methods to understand a specific group\u2019s shared experiences and behaviors, such as open-ended questions or contextual observation. It\u2019s instrumental during the discovery phase of the design process or when working with small sample sizes that won\u2019t yield large quantities of data.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n    <p>The demand for research and design continues to rise since it can<span>&nbsp;</span> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design\" target=\"_blank\">positively impact business</a>. We will continue to see new tools, methods, and strategies to meet the demand for scale and speed without compromising the research\u2019s integrity. Frameworks like Google Sprints and Lean UX have become more common and can save a lot of time. The new field of ResearchOps finds ways to optimize and automate specific processes that can slow down research, such as participant recruiting.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/research-ops-framework.jpeg\" alt=\"Research Ops diagram\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/research-ops-101/\" target=\"_blank\">ResearchOps 101 (nngroup.com)</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>There is a limit to letting speed dictate user research, however. The Director of Design and User Research at Microsoft, Joe Munko distinguishes disposable and timeless research:</p>\n    <blockquote>If you cut corners on quality, customer involvement, and adaptive planning, your research could become disposable\u2026I know, that\u2019s a bold statement. But here\u2019s why: When time constraints force us to drop the rigor and process that incorporates customer feedback, the user research you conduct loses its validity and ultimately its value. \u2014Joe Munko,<span>&nbsp;</span> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/customer-insights-research/articles/skip-user-research-unless-youre-doing-it-right-seriously/\" target=\"_blank\">Skip User Research Unless You\u2019re Doing It Right \u2014 Seriously</a></blockquote>\n    <p>Research is an iterative process. By baking it into the whole design process, you will grow a larger body of knowledge about your users and their needs. Meaningful research should compound value beyond a single feature or project. Therefore, how you plan, execute, synthesize, and communicate research is a significant factor in your design\u2019s quality and longevity.</p>\n</section>"

This is a qualitative research method that takes place in the natural setting of the activity you are interested in exploring. As a researcher, you should immerse yourself in the world of the user so that you can find out what's meaningful from those who know the most.</p>\n<p>You should think of yourself as a student when conducting contextual interviews, and let the user teach you. While the user is performing the activity, they can impart knowledge by talking about it, and you can ask questions in the moment. Developing this relationship allows you to learn more about people's motives and emotions. You see not only what people do, but also why they do it.</p>\n<p>Imagine the last time you felt intense frustration doing an activity. Maybe you had to file your taxes, wait in line at the DMV, or fill out a series of poorly designed forms online. If a researcher had the opportunity to listen to you talk out loud as you performed this tedious activity, it would be possible to learn a great deal about you and the activity. By responding to your emotional energy when faced with this frustrating task, the researcher will learn surprising details. By asking specific questions about their observations, they will uncover information that otherwise would be difficult to discover.</p>\n<p>In essence, you get better data about an activity by having users describe it as they do it. It is the objects and context of an activity that help users recall key details and past memories.</p>\n<p>When you observe the same behaviors across several users, patterns may emerge. There are clues to designing for people hidden in the details of daily life.</p>\n<p>You want to get as close to the activity as possible</p>\n<p>Observe how the target activities fit into the context of daily life. Time, place, what platforms, products, or devices are used? How do people collaborate or coordinate to get things done? How does policy or organizational structure affect what what people are doing?</p>\n<p>Getting this rich data requires concrete instances of the activity as it plays out in people\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p>So avoid summaries and abstractions by pulling users back to a real activity and away from easy generalizations. \u201cWhen was the last time you did that?\u201d \u201cCan you show me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ask to see real artifacts the user creates or uses while doing the activity.</p>\n<p>If the user is telling a story about something that happened, you will need to watch out for summarization and omitted detail. Most people start telling a story in the middle. You can help them out by having them play out recent past events in detail by going step-by-step in order to help the user remember.</p>\n<p>As you watch the user perform the activity, you, the researcher will be looking for pattern and structure. When you see something that doesn\u2019t fit or you want to verify your sense of the underlying structure of the activity, you should cause a break in the action and discuss what you just saw. Then direct the user to return to the ongoing activity.</p>\n<p>By alternating between watching and probing, you are creating space for reflection. The user may even start interrupting themselves and revealing aspects of the activity that might otherwise have been missed.</p>"

Every successful product or service has to find a competitive edge that differentiates it from what is already offered. Why should customers use your product idea over other solutions? Competitive research is all about finding out how you can stand out in some way. Will you compete on price, speed, simplicity, convenience, accessibility?</p>\n    <p>Competitive research coupled with credible user research sets you up to make better decisions during all stages of the design process. From a user perspective, it\u2019s about understanding the context within which they make decisions\u2013particularly the decision to adopt and remain loyal to your product.</p>\n    <p>Insights from competitive research will feedback into your design strategy in the form of decisions made along the way. But it also has several other benefits, including:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Finding standards and best practices in that particular domain.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Building more domain knowledge.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Learn from mistakes and avoid \u201creinventing the wheel.\u201d</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Who is your customer?</h2>\n    <p>Remember, the customer is not everybody on the internet. By now, you have a good idea of who the primary customer segment will be. Any personas created will be based on the type of customer who needs your product to do a particular job to make progress on some goal.</p>\n    <p>Your problem statement should also indicate who most needs the solution you intend to offer. The target segment should be specific\u2013you want the type of customer who will rave about what your product does. The segments are a combination of demographic and psychographic attributes, but most important is that they concisely describe a set of people who are separate from everyone else.</p>\n    <p>Examples:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Aspiring artists who want their work to be easier to find online</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Parents in big cities who want their kids more involved in community activities</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Who is your competitor?</h2>\n    <p>A competitor will have similar goals as you. Direct competitors (like Uber vs. Lyft) have very similar value propositions for the same type of customers. Indirect competitors have a different value proposition but might solve some of the same needs as you for the customer. (Uber vs. public transit).

Competitive analysis can go pretty deep and be time-consuming. You\u2019ll need to capture both quantitative and qualitative information, but don\u2019t document metrics just for the sake of it. Define your goals for doing the research.</p>\n    <h3>Typical goals for a competitive analysis</h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">First hand knowledge of the good and bad user experiences</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Industry trends</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Best practices</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Design conventions</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">(Un)successful business models</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Marketing tactics</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\">Outdated mental models</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Focus on the criteria you can best leverage into actionable insights.

To decide on the most appropriate course of action, you need a coherent view of what\u2019s working and why, and how you plan to take advantage of what you learned. What essential features and opportunities are going to help you stand out in the market? How can you radically improve the customers\u2019 lives in a way that makes them turn away from what\u2019s already out there? It\u2019s not about<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2010/03/01/death-by-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">cramming in all the same features as your competitors</a>. Instead, aim to use competitive intelligence to offer remarkable improvements in your problem space.</p>\n    <p>Make sure to time block yourself for this step. It\u2019s easy to go down rabbit holes when analyzing large quantities of data. Try to spend an equal amount of time on each competitor so you end up with a balanced perspective.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/feature-comparison.png\" alt=\"sample quantitative competitive analysis\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/guide-to-competitive-analysis-ux-design/\" target=\"_blank\">A Guide to Competitive Analysis for UX Design</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</section>"

Given a certain set of circumstances, and a certain set of options, how will users behave?</p>\n    <h3>Eye tracking</h3>\n    <p>Eye tracking devices measure eye positions and eye movement. To do so, they uses a special light to create a reflection in the person\u2019s eyes\u2013a reflection then captured by cameras in the eye tracker. Data regarding eye position and eye movement is then projected onto the UI, resulting in a visualization of where the participant looked.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/eye-tracking.png\" alt=\"Eye tracking heat map of the Humira medicine website\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5472/files/2977825\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/eyetracking-setup/\">Setup of an Eyetracking Study</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>Contextual inquiries</h3>\n    <p>Contextual inquiries are a fairly informal research method that can provide more natural and realistic results than more formal tests.

Once users are recruited, researchers observe those users attempting to complete the task while asking them to think aloud and describe their mental process.</p>\n    <p>While contextual inquiries tend to involve testing live products, usability testing can be conducted using <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-a-prototype-a-guide-to-functional-ux/\" target=\"_blank\">prototypes</a> that simulate the final product and allow design teams to validate ideas before committing to them.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n    <h2>Attitudinal research methods</h2>\n    <p>The second category of qualitative research methods, <strong>attitudinal research methods,</strong> reveal what users think, feel, or say.

While surveys are relatively easy to distribute, and the data collected can be a bit easier to synthesize than other research methods, users tend to be reluctant to complete them unless they\u2019re brief and clearly written.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 600px;\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/user-surveys.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5472/files/2977931\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/how-to-create-effective-user-surveys-1cea4b06ff76\">How to Create Effective User Surveys</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>User surveys are prone to bias, so it helps to have a checklist for <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://delighted.com/blog/avoid-7-types-sampling-response-survey-bias\" target=\"_blank\">avoiding bias</a> handy when crafting or reviewing your questions.</p>\n    <h3>Focus groups</h3>\n    <p>While most methods of qualitative research involve one target user at a time, focus groups work with a larger group.

While participants will likely choose the most aesthetically appealing option, researchers can instruct participants to judge designs based on their perceived trustworthiness or success at communicating a particular message.</p>\n</section>"

Can I figure out what information they're after? Do they seem to like what I have to say, or are they judging me?\" There is a lot of emotion there: wonder, distrust, fear, doubt, worry. If you are aware of the particular emotion a participant is experiencing, you can step up to support them. You can demonstrate warmth, human support, and clarity of direction to the participant.

What do you do when you first sit down at your station? Then what do you do next?\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask about quantity.</strong> \"How many files would you delete when that happens?\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask for specific examples.</strong> \"What is the last movie you streamed?\" \u2013 Compare this to \"What movies do you stream?\" The specific is easier to answer than the general and becomes a platform for follow up questions.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask for the complete list.</strong> \"What are all the different apps you have installed on your smartphone?\" \u2013 This will require a series of follow up questions, e.g., \"What else?\" because few people will be able to generate an entire list of something with some prompting.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask about relationships.</strong> \"How do you work with new vendors?\" \u2013 This general question is especially appropriate when you don't even know enough to ask a specific question (e.g. in comparison to the earlier example about streaming movies). Better to start general than to be presumptive with a too-specific question.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask about organizational structure.</strong> \"Who does that department report to?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Questions to probe on what's unsaid</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask for clarification.</strong> \"When you refer to \"that\" you are talking about the newest server, right?\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask about code words/native language.</strong> \"Why do you call it the 'Batcave?'\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask about emotional cues.</strong> \"Why do you laugh when you mention 'Best Buy?'\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Ask why.</strong> \"I've tried to get my boss to adopt this format, but she just won't do it-\" \"Why do you think she hasn't?\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Probe delicately.</strong> \"You mentioned a difficult situation that changed your usage. Can you tell us what that situation was?\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Probe without presuming.</strong> \"Some people have very negative feelings about Twitter, while others don't. What is your take?\" \u2013 Rather than the direct \"What do you think about Twitter?\" or \"Do you like Twitter?\" This question introduces options that aren't tied to the interviewer or the interviewee.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Explain to an outsider. \"Let's say that I've just arrived here from another decade, how would you explain to me the difference between smartphones and tablets?\"</strong></li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Teach another.</strong> \"If you had to ask your daughter to operate your system, how would you explain it to her?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Questions that create contrasts to uncover frameworks and mental models</h3>\n<ul style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Compare processes.</strong> \"What's the difference between sending your response by fax, mail or email?\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Compare to others.</strong> \"Do the other coaches also do it that way?\"</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Compare across time.</strong> \"How have your family photo activities changed in the past five years? How do you think they will be different five years from now?\" \u2013 The second question is not intended to capture an accurate prediction. Rather, the question serves to break free from what exists now and envision possibilities that may emerge down the road. Identify the appropriately large time horizon (a year? Five years? Ten years?) that will help people to think beyond incremental change.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>Interviewing best practices</h2>\n<figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/User-interview-woman-filming-herself.jpg\" alt=\"woman using an iPhone to record herself during an interview\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5472/files/2908997\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n<figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/user-interview\" target=\"_blank\">How to Conduct a User Interview That Actually Uncovers Valuable Insights</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Use neutral, conversational cues</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to keep the participant speaking and providing more detail or deeper reflections.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Do not rush through the questions or assume that silence indicates the participant has finished their thoughts.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Though awkward at first, Lingering silence cues the participant that there is more space for them: to take time to think, to reconsider, to add more detail.

So take reasonable care in how you write survey questions. Your goal is to write questions that are 1) easy to read, 2) free of bias, and 3) answered accurately. <strong>Always pre-test your survey questions to evaluate how people respond.</strong></p>\n    <p>Decide what topics you will cover in your survey. Collaborate and discuss these topics with others. Each topic and the related question should have a justification for being included.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Questions can be open-ended or closed-ended.</h2>\n    <p>Open-ended questions require more effort and time to answer by asking users to write answers in a text box. Asking too many of them may result in lower participation. Use open-ended questions when you want participants to provide context, inner thinking, or experience.</p>\n    <p>Closed questions can yield quantitative or qualitative data. They\u2019re faster to answer since participants do not need to provide specific details or context supporting their responses. Instead, they choose from a list of answers using checkboxes, radio buttons, or rating scales.</p>\n    <p>You can re-write many open-ended questions as close-ended questions. Consider <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/u-s-survey-research/questionnaire-design/\" target=\"_blank\">this insight from Pew Research</a> about a survey poll question.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n        <p>...in a poll conducted after the presidential election in 2008, people responded very differently to two versions of this question: \u201cWhat one issue mattered most to you in deciding how you voted for president?\u201d One was closed-ended and the other open-ended. In the closed-ended version, respondents were provided five options (and could volunteer an option not on the list).</p>\n        <p>When explicitly offered the economy as a response, more than half of respondents (58%) chose this answer; only 35% of those who responded to the open-ended version volunteered the economy. Moreover, among those asked the closed-ended version, fewer than one-in-ten (8%) provided a response other than the five they were read; by contrast fully 43% of those asked the open-ended version provided a response not listed in the closed-ended version of the question. All of the other issues were chosen at least slightly more often when explicitly offered in the closed-ended version than in the open-ended version.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Pew Research often runs pilot studies with open-ended questions to discover the most common answers. Then they develop close-ended questions based on the results from the study. A product designer could accomplish the same thing by asking a specific set of open-ended questions during user interviews or focus groups.</p>\n</section>\n<section style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\">\n    <h2>Writing effective questions</h2>\n    <p>There are two parts to every survey question, the question itself and the provided set of answers. Let\u2019s examine what makes a questionnaire effective. (Hint: These heuristics are also perfect for writing interview questions.)</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>The flow of questions should be logical and organized.</strong> A good questionnaire does not change topics in a jarring manner. If you ask people about the experience of using a medical device, don\u2019t ask them who their favorite author is. The <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100345687?rskey=56jXHI&amp;result=1\" target=\"_blank\">priming effect</a> can also be a factor in the order of questions. This effect occurs when a previous question influences a participant\u2019s answer.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Each question should be limited to a single concept.</strong> If you ask about more than one concept, it\u2019s unclear which one the participant responds to. \u201cHow many times have you eaten junk food or fast food in the last week?\u201d is unclear about which item (junk food, fast food) they should answer. Additionally, the definition of both of those items is not universal.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Each question should be easy to understand.</strong> Questions with ambiguous meaning or multiple interpretations will result in wrong answers. Remember, your job is to minimize the risk of someone answering incorrectly. Also, if it\u2019s appropriate, <em>use a conversational tone</em> to keep the participant engaged in the questions. Avoid double-negatives, unfamiliar jargon, and abbreviations.</li>\n    </ul>\n  \n  <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/uxbooth-illo-usersurveysurvey2-1024x852.png\" alt=\"Illustration of a user considering 4 options.\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-essential-guide-to-writing-effective-survey-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">The Essential Guide to Writing Effective Survey Questions</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  \n</section>\n<section>\n    <h2>Writing an answer set</h2>\n    <p><strong>The answer set should be relatively small.</strong> People have a tough time remembering more than a few options. Unless you ask about an objective fact like what brand of vehicle they own, keep the answer list small. If you ask the questions aloud, the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100407678\" target=\"_blank\">recency effect</a> may cause participants to choose items heard later in a list. That is why it is best practice to randomize the options list to ensure they are not in the same order for each person.</p>\n    <p><strong>The answer set should include all reasonable responses.</strong> If you are asking about an objective fact, let\u2019s say what pet you own, then it would be appropriate to have more than just a cat and dog in the answer set.</p>\n    <p><strong>Include an opt-out option in an answer set.</strong> In the example above, an opt-out response would be \u201cI don\u2019t have a pet\u201d or \u201cDoes not apply.\u201d If you don\u2019t include this option, you are forcing the participant to choose an answer that is not true.</p>\n    <p><strong>Balance answers when using a scale.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>For example,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>very bad</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>bad</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neutral</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>good</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>very good</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is a balanced answer set. The gap between<span>&nbsp;</span><em>bad</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neutral</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and between<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neutral</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>good</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is easily understood as equal. It\u2019s also an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>ordinal scale</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>because the order of options is significant.</p>\n    <p>Answer set:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>extremely disappointed, disappointed, kind of disappointed, not at all disappointed, neutral.</em></p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>The scale is not balanced.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The distance between<span>&nbsp;</span><em>extremely disappointed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>disappointed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>does not appear to be the same as the distance between<span>&nbsp;</span><em>not at all disappointed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neutral</em>.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>The scale is not ordinal.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>It tries to measure the attitude towards a subject from worse to progressively better, but the difference between<span>&nbsp;</span><em>not at all disappointed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neutral</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is unclear.<br>Better answer set:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>extremely disappointed, somewhat disappointed, doesn\u2019t bother me, somewhat happy, extremely happy.</em></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Neutral is a valid answer.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>When you use an odd-numbered scale (Likert-type), it measures positive or negative responses. Neutral as the middle option gives your scale symmetry with equal negative and positive choices.

The analysis focuses on breaking down complex information into more manageable components, while synthesis focuses on piecing together information to form complete ideas. This creates a more detailed and holistic understanding and provides a more precise picture of the problem needing to be solved. This process typically occurs sometime after research and before ideation, but it\u2019s good to revisit the problem throughout the design process as things progress and discoveries are made.</p>\n    <p>Problem statements, also known as point-of-view (POV) statements, are the articulated form of the problem you\u2019re trying to solve for. They are straightforward, actionable descriptions of the issues and challenges that need to be addressed, based on research and user insights. They often express a point of view, highlight an unmet need or goal of the user, and identify a gap between the current state and the desired state of the design.</p>\n    <p>In addition to providing clarity and focus on the problem being solved, there are many added benefits of leveraging problem statements, such as:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Collaboration:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Problem statements distill a potentially complex problem space into a more digestible form, making it easier to communicate and align with other team members and stakeholders in the project.

They help guide and focus the ideation process.</li>\n    </ul>\n</section>\n<section>\n    <h2>Common Problem Statement Challenges</h2>\n    <p>Done properly, problem statements provide meaningful context and encourage action, helping to kickstart, guide, and focus the ideation process. However, writing an effective problem statement means confronting a number of challenges.</p>\n    <h3>Your problem statement is based on assumptions instead of research</h3>\n    <p>Assumptions are a necessary part of the design process. They allow designers to form hypotheses that guide research and testing efforts. However, it\u2019s essential to be aware of what is an assumption and what is a fact. Don\u2019t be afraid to<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-challenge-assumptions\" target=\"_blank\">challenge assumptions</a>, facts, and even user needs that aren\u2019t supported by research.</p>\n    <p>For example, you might find yourself working on a project where you inherit a problem statement. As much as possible, try to validate whether it is a problem, a symptom, or an assumption about the problem. Is the problem statement outdated or missing key findings? You might find that it is based on assumptions rather than actual data points. In this case, it might be helpful to establish an initial or assumptive problem statement to guide further research until you\u2019re able to define a final problem statement. Just make sure that everyone involved knows that it\u2019s based on assumptions and requires additional validation.</p>\n    <h3>Clear writing is hard</h3>\n    <p>The main goal of the problem statement is to communicate the core problem based on your research. It should provide guidance and alignment for team members and stakeholders. Because of this, written communication skills are critical, and not everyone is highly proficient.</p>\n    <p>What can you do if writing isn\u2019t your strong point and you aren\u2019t teamed up with a good writer? A good starting point is to remember that a problem statement is a deliverable and, like many other design deliverables, can and should be tested and validated. Get feedback from anyone involved in the project. Does their interpretation of your problem statement align with what you intended to communicate? Not only will you be able to pinpoint unclear and confusing points of your problem statement, but you might even gather feedback that can improve the focus of the problem itself.</p>\n    <h3>Your team disagrees on what the problem is</h3>\n    <p>Each stakeholder and team member will have their own opinions and interpretation of the problem, and sometimes this can even cause disagreements amongst the team. While it\u2019s crucial to gain buy-in from stakeholders and other team members, involving them shouldn\u2019t become a blocker for the project.</p>\n    <p>Collaborative synthesis sessions can still be productive. For example, a group may brainstorm potential problem statements, and a smaller subset of participants will synthesize the collected input. Then, time permitting, you might present the synthesized problem statement to the large group for feedback.</p>\n    <h3>Your problem statement addresses symptoms, not actual problems</h3>\n    <p>It\u2019s easy to mistake the symptoms caused by a problem for the problem itself. The problem statement should represent the root cause. Let\u2019s say someone tells you that they have a sore throat and, after further inquiry, you realize that it\u2019s because they have mono. While you could offer them a cough drop, that only solves for an immediate, short-term need, whereas recommending they see a doctor and get medicine would address the root cause and ultimately alleviate the sore throat (i.e., the symptom) as well.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/tree.jpg\" alt=\"Does this unhealthy tree need water?

As designers, it\u2019s our job to dig deeper, keep asking questions, and challenge assumptions to uncover the root cause. The most impactful time to do this is during the research stages of the project. But it is healthy to revisit the validity and focus of your problem statement throughout a project. Further research and testing may expose that what you thought was a root problem was just a symptom, and that\u2019s okay. Be prepared to be flexible.</p>\n    <h3>There are too many problems to address</h3>\n    <p>Depending on the length of the project and the bandwidth of your team, you might consider establishing multiple problem statements. Possibly, you have a primary problem statement that you prioritize your efforts to tackle, but you also have a secondary problem statement that you\u2019re always keeping in mind.</p>\n    <p>You might identify that there\u2019s a future problem that you currently don\u2019t have the resources or ability to address, but it\u2019s worth establishing to encourage your team to consider more long-term goals while you solve for a more attainable, current problem. Or, you might find that there are distinctly different problems depending on the type of user, in which case you might find it helpful to establish a problem statement per user type.</p>\n    <p>Keep in mind that having multiple problem statements isn\u2019t always the right solution. Adding more focuses into the mix can cause more confusion than add value. It might make more sense for your team and the project to narrow down and focus on one problem statement.</p>\n    <p>In these cases, the best approach is to keep asking questions and digging deeper into research to challenge each problem statement\u2019s assumptions. Based on what you learn, it might become obvious which problem statement to move forward with. You might also find that you need to combine, adapt, or completely start over to get to the most impactful problem statement.</p>\n    <h3>Your problem statement addresses a user want instead of a user need.</h3>\n    <p>As you assess research and user insights to create your problem statement, it\u2019s essential to recognize that users do not always know what they need and, more often than not, they share their wants. These significantly differ from needs because they\u2019re usually based on personal preferences that may vary from user to user.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/henry-ford.png\" alt=\"'If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.'

This should reflect the synthesis of many user touchpoints and should not be based on just a handful of users. Avoid framing the need as a solution, such as specific product features. (tip: needs are often <em>verbs</em>, whereas solutions are often <em>nouns</em>.)</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Why are you solving it?</strong> The relevant insight typically articulates why the need is important to the user or the result of meeting the specified need.

The \u201cwe\u201d in HMW refers to the people in the room, not to the users, customers, or populations for whom teams are designing their products and services. The prompt looks inward instead of outward, encouraging people to build solutions that suit their own needs and experiences. They end up with offerings that don\u2019t serve customer needs, and may even hurt the people they\u2019re meant to help.</p>\n        <p><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90649969/the-most-popular-design-thinking-strategy-is-bs\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90649969/the-most-popular-design-thinking-strategy-is-bs\">The most popular design thinking strategy is BS</a>, Tricia Wang</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>After writing 'How Might We' questions, reflect on the impact that your solutions could have on people.

You can quickly jump on a whiteboard to provide more context around an idea and get immediate feedback. Or, you can even facilitate a quick <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/sketch-sessions-make-friends-and-design-better-3762e5842e7a\" target=\"_blank\">sketch session</a> with stakeholders to better understand where they\u2019re at and what they\u2019re thinking.</p>\n    <h3>Misconception #1: I\u2019m not an artist, so I can\u2019t sketch.</h3>\n    <p>Sketching is a form of communication and not a work of art, and, despite popular belief, it\u2019s not the same as drawing or illustrating. If you can draw basic shapes, you can sketch. The goal is to be understood; it\u2019s often the most simple line drawings that create the most significant understanding.</p>\n  \n  <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sketching-UI.jpeg\" alt=\"A sketch of common UI elements.\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Sketching UI pattern conventions.

As a designer, you might feel pressured to produce beautiful deliverables, even with your sketches.</p><p>Sketching should be quick and efficient, requiring minimal resources. It\u2019s a way to focus on brainstorming ideas and solving problems without the distractions of making something look good. It\u2019s a way to work through these ideas and issues collaboratively, in real-time. It\u2019s by no means meant to be the end state and shouldn\u2019t be approached like it is.</p>\n    <h3>Misconception #3: Sketching is unprofessional.</h3>\n    <p>Sketching can also be undervalued and written off as an elementary activity due to the low fidelity aesthetic. This often comes down to expectation setting and communicating the value of sketching.</p><p>Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re presenting to a group of stakeholders a new product feature. Provided you give context and foundational understanding the project is still in stages of ideation, a sketch can be as acceptable as a time-consumed finessed design. If you frame ideation meetings as a collaborative brainstorming session and create alignment around expectations and goals, you\u2019ll be more likely to receive open-minded responses to the \u2018crude\u2019 nature of sketches.</p>\n    <h3>Misconception #4: Sketching is the same as paper wireframing.</h3>\n    <p>As we\u2019ve learned, sketching is meant to be quick and dirty, and it focuses on capturing and conveying an idea, thought, or subject. It is not limited to interfaces; sketches can be used to brainstorm, capture meeting takeaways, or synthesize information.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, paper wireframes are more exact and are used to start thinking about how UI elements are laid out on a screen. Paper wireframes need to be executed more carefully than sketches, since they typically communicate information to a user for testing purposes.</p>\n    <h3>Misconception #5: Sketching takes too much time.</h3>\n    <p>When sketching ideas that will lead to a more polished end deliverable, one thing to consider is that, at some point, you\u2019ll need to translate your sketches into the final deliverable. While this can feel like you\u2019re adding an extra step, it\u2019s saving a lot of time and headaches later on by validating ideas quickly and iteratively before committing to a single, potentially wrong, solution.</p>\n    <h3>Misconception #6: Sketches don\u2019t require iteration.</h3>\n    <p>While a benefit of sketches is that they\u2019re disposable, they can still be revisited and iterated on to be more effective. The fact that they\u2019re disposable helps us feel less attached to specific ideas and designs, and so sketching is one of the simplest and most effective methods for rapid ideation. Sketching is also a skill, and as such, the more you do it, the better you\u2019ll get at it.</p>\n  \n  <div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;\"><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVx9RLCnJH8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div>\n</section>"

Users are given a task to complete and are encouraged to think aloud, or verbalize their thoughts and decision-making processes as they move through the user interface.</p>\n    <p>Typically, the goals of a usability test include</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Uncover problems</strong> in the design</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Discover opportunities</strong> to improve the design</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Learn about users</strong> and their behavior and preferences</li>\n    </ul>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/usability-test-paper.png\" alt=\"A usability test conducted with paper prototypes\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5472/files/2995460\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/usability-testing-what-is-it-how-to-do-it-51356e5de5d\" target=\"_blank\">Usability testing: what is it and how to do it?</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p><strong>Rapid usability testing</strong> lowers the risk of solving for the wrong problem or building the wrong solution. It involves gathering feedback using low-to-mid fidelity designs such as paper prototypes and wireframes. Discovering problems early means avoiding wasting money, time, and resources developing a flawed design.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n    <h2>Elements of usability testing</h2>\n    <h3>Participant</h3>\n    <p>Usability test participants should fall into the product\u2019s target audience. This might mean someone who is already using the product or service in everyday life, but it could also be someone with similar characteristics or needs of a target user group.</p>\n    <p>Participants shouldn\u2019t tap silently through a wireframe prototype (or point silently at a paper prototype.) Instead, they should be encouraged to <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">think out loud</a> so observers can better understand participant behaviors, goals, thoughts, and motivations.</p>\n    <h3>Task</h3>\n    <p>During usability tests, participants should be provided with a realistic, actionable <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/task-scenarios-usability-testing/\" target=\"_blank\">task scenario</a>. Task scenarios are actions participants should be able to accomplish using a provided interface. These scenarios should reflect realistic goals that most visitors to your site or application may wish to reach.</p>\n    <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; max-width: 720px;\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"viewer/files/Uploaded%20Media/task-scenario.PNG\" alt=\"\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/5472/files/2995572\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">\n        <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: .9rem; margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem;\">Source: <a href=\"https://dscout.com/people-nerds/usability-task-writing\" target=\"_blank\">How to Write More Effective Usability Testing Tasks</a></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <ul>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Keep tasks realistic.</strong> Give users one task at a time, and allow the user freedom to apply their own decision making criteria. <em>Find a pair of sneakers costing less than $100</em> allows the user more freedom than <em>find a pair of red Nike high-tops</em>.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Keep tasks actionable.</strong> Use action verbs like <em>sign up</em>, <em>download</em>, or <em>purchase</em> to encourage users to interact with the interface to solve for a specific need.</li>\n        <li style=\"margin-bottom: .5rem;\"><strong>Avoid precise instructions.</strong> Don\u2019t mention specific interface items or sections of your product, and avoid terms like <em>click on</em> or <em>go to</em> that might lead your user toward a specific outcome.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Facilitator</h3>\n    <p>A facilitator is present to guide the participant through the usability test process. A facilitator needs to be able to provide instructions, answer participant questions, and ask clarifying questions in response to participant comments <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/leading-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">without influencing the participant\u2019s feedback or behavior</a>.</p>\n    <p>If a facilitator is not present, this is known as an <strong>unmoderated usability test</strong>. Unmoderated tests remove the possibility of the facilitator influencing the outcomes. On the other hand, unmoderated tests lack the possibility of asking follow-up questions or clarifying participant statements.</p>\n</section>"
